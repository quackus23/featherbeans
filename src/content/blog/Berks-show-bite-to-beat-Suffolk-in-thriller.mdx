title: Berks show bite to beat Suffolk in thriller
---

##

Suffolk produced an inspired fielding performance to come within one wicket of defending 95 in the second T20 of the day at Chipstead CC. But despite their best efforts, they went home empty-handed as Lily Bowlby carried Berkshire over the line with an unbeaten 32.

### Hughes show hauls Suffolk to competitive total

Berkshire won the toss, and challenged Suffolk to improve upon their showing against Surrey half an hour earlier.

After a serene opening, captain Amelie Clarke kicked into gear with a pair of legside boundaries from Freya Johnson's second over. Her encouraging innings ended on 10 in the next over, though - bowled by the pace of Molly Bulteel.

Nat Samuels came in and added some early positivity - running 2 out to deep backward point, before an edge sailed away to the third man boundary. Southern Vipers' Poppy Tulloch was greeted with another four, this time driven gracefully through mid-off. Suffolk were going along nicely enough, at 25-1 from five overs.

Kali-Ann Docherty shifted the momentum with a one-run sixth over, before Tulloch claimed the wicket of Samuels in the seventh. Opener Sophie Hughes hadn't seen much of the strike up to this point, but announced herself with a beautiful cover drive.

She could count herself lucky to have been at the other end as spinner Shayna Chikhlia entered the fray. Spin was effective throughout the day, particularly up the hill, and this game was no exception. Chikhlia's first ball enticed Liv Hyndman into a slog to midwicket, which fell into the hands of Docherty. Her fourth was swept by Jess Board to square leg, to leave Suffolk wobbling at 37-4.

A lovely wristy sweep from Docherty's third over suggested Hughes was out to play. Unintimidated by Chikhlia's two wickets, the left-hander added two boundaries down the ground to take 12 from the spinner; she then flicked another, through backward square leg against Docherty.

But the setbacks kept coming. Lily Bowlby replaced Chikhlia, and also took two in her first over. Immy Sidhu was held well at square leg again, before her sister Izzy was judged lbw having added two.

Megan Haynes added four off Bulteel's 14th over, but was caught behind on Bowlby's return. Suffolk desperately needed somebody to stick with Hughes, and CJ Oastler obliged. The pair added 19 from 19, with Hughes reaching the long-off boundary and Oastler running two to third man, to bring 100 into sight.

But it was not to be; Oastler's wicket, chipped to midwicket in the 18th over, was the first of a slide of 3 wickets for 7 runs at the end of the innings. After Bowlby kept the 19th to just one run, Tulloch had Hughes caught at point for 36 before Amber Bradnam was run out from the last ball.

Tulloch and Bowlby took three wickets each to stop their opponents from truly getting away, but Hughes' innings gave Suffolk something substantial to defend.

### Defiant display ends in defeat

Without too many runs to play with, Suffolk needed a stellar fielding performance to take something away from the day.

The opening exchanges were up and down. Tulloch cut powerfully to the boundary off Immy Sidhu's first over, but saw her scoring restricted by Amber Bradnam and lifted the 12th ball of the innings into mid-off's hands. Francesca Sweet then avenged her opening partner with six runs down the hill to cow corner, before suffering the same fate - this time hitting Bradnam to Jess Board at midwicket.

Board took a similar catch, Abigail Avery for a duck, in the fifth over before being in the action again in the sixth. A Bradnam full toss was stopped by Board; batter Ash Muttitt was halfway down the track before she realised, and could not get back before the run-out was completed by keeper CJ Oastler. Berks were 26-4 at the end of the powerplay; Suffolk were on top.

Lily Bowlby was next to the crease, and set about changing that with Izzy Storrar - the pair added 18 in the next 19 deliveries. The highlight of their partnership was a Bowlby boundary off Izzy Sidhu - she pierced the gap in the covers perfectly to find the rope - but the spinner struck back later in that over, clipping Storrar's bails.

Poppy Sidhu bowled Freya Johnson three balls later to leave Suffolk firmly in charge, although new batter Poppy Camplin did strike back immediately with a late cut for four. That shot caused another shift in momentum: the Berks pair were relatively circumspect to begin with, but added 22 in three overs to move just 18 runs away from their target.

Amelie Clarke turned to Sophie Hughes to make something happen, and that's exactly what she did. Against Surrey, Amy Gordon had sent Hughes' first ball over the ropes; Camplin could only chip the ball up, and watch the spinner take a nonchalant one-handed catch above her head. Hughes conceded just one from the over, and the match was in the balance once more.

Clarke stayed on at the other end despite her first over costing nine, and it paid off. Docherty was bowled for 2, before Board took another catch at midwicket - the hardest of the three, as Bulteel sent the ball a long way up.

The equation was 14 runs from 3 overs. Bowlby had to score; Chikhlia at the other end had to survive.

Hughes kept the 18th over down to just four, thanks to some exceptional fielding by Liv Hyndman. She had been running along the boundary all afternoon, and saved countless runs in the process.

Clarke had ten runs to play with, and the number eleven on strike. A no-ball early on, which ran away for four byes, simplified things for Berkshire - now needing four from eleven - but the seamer atoned, with four dots.

A Chikhlia cut to deep backward point cost two vital runs, though, leaving Hughes - in the end crowned player of the match - with just two more to defend. The batters took a single each, with no real risk of being run-out, to guide Berks to victory with two balls to spare.
