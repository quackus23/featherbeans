title: Blackpool Lights shine on Balderson

##

When you think of players for big moments, there is one name which particularly stands apart.

A northerner. An aggressive seam bowler. A left handed, middle-order batter. A versatile player, who does what his team needs.

George Balderson stood up on Monday afternoon. With Durham 380-5, meandering more than cruising but heading nonetheless towards an obscene target of 475, Lancashire needed a wicket. They needed five - but that seemed a million miles away.

The rub of the Blackpool green seemed to be with the visitors, as the 81st over saw a top edge by centurion Ollie Robinson land perfectly between three fielders. And despite a scattered innings from England captain Ben Stokes ending with a reverse sweep on 18 a few overs beforehand, it felt like a sign that the world was rooting for Durham.

This clearly irked Balderson. Returning to the attack to take the new ball, following 7 wicketless overs earlier on, he provided the breakthrough that Lancashire needed.

Then another breakthrough, which they also needed.

And another one.

A relatively innocuous first over was followed by the opposite. Graham Clark, fresh from taking Tom Aspinwall for 10, was first on the menu: his edge gathered by Matthew Hurst behind the stumps.

The slip cordon was then fed by Paul Coughlin's edge: captain Keaton Jennings, as he did in both batting innings, leaving no crumbs.

Balderson completed his initial burst with a caught and bowled, toying with Ben Raine before drawing an inside edge, and pulling out a truly Stokes-like full-stretch dive, to finish off the Durham veteran.

It would admittedly be a reach to give much credit for the ninth wicket to the 23-year-old. The first ball of his eleventh over saw a mix-up, ending in the sacrifice of Matthew Potts - run out for two. This could go instead to fellow seamer Will Williams: not relieving any pressure, with five dots and a single off the last to keep Ollie Robinson away from the strike.

Potts, a capable batter but no Robinson, knew where Durham's hopes lay - the motive behind both a slightly reckless attempted single, and his ultimately selfless decision to cross and thus take the blow.

And Robinson quickly honoured him. 22 runs came from the next 12 deliveries faced by the wicketkeeper. His fourth six, slog swept into the leg-side, brought about another ball change. The tail-influenced charge is not a new concept, but Robinson's demonstration with Stokes in attendance surely has done him no harm.

A four to finish the penultimate over, advancing down the track to a genuine great in Nathan Lyon, brought up his first-class best of 171 in 206 balls. But he had no further opportunity to add to it.

You've read the script. Balderson, returning to the attack once more, saw the ball flying away from Callum Parkinson and into the hands of his captain yet again. A fitting end, for sure: for all the efforts of the all-rounder, the way Jennings stood tall with twin hundreds would beat anyone to a player of the match award.

A word, too, for Tom Aspinwall: five wickets in the first innings, effectively on debut, were followed by two of the first three breakthroughs on Sunday evening.

And last but not least, Ollie Robinson, who was left stranded on 171\*. There is no reason to believe he would not have chased the mammoth target alone, had he had the chance.

Blackpool always seems to attract the legends. Lyon versus Stokes was the main act, but it feels likely that both Balderson and Robinson will soon demand top billing.
