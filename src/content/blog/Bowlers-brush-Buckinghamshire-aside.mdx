##

Suffolk steamed past Buckinghamshire by eight wickets to record a second victory of their 50-over campaign. A resounding win was needed to keep touch with Northamptonshire in third place, who had earlier demolished Lincolnshire.

### Fielding feats aid Sidhu strangle

Captain Lauren Swinburne opted to take the ball first, with a few clouds around. She justified the decision only a few balls later: left-handed Molly Carter was caught with an excellent low catch by Jess Board at point.

That brought home captain Amelia Peck to the crease, joining opener Amelia Ridgway. The former took a single off Swinburne's last ball, before seeing off a maiden from spinner Immy Sidhu.

Swinburne was consistent, regularly getting the ball to rise and beat the bat. She did stray full in the fifth over - a mistake punished with Bucks' first boundary - but repented with a maiden in the seventh.

Emily Cunningham took over her captain's end for the thirteenth over, and took a moment to find her length - starting with a no-ball for height, followed by four swept through backward square.

The over was still successful for Suffolk, in slightly strange fashion. A straight drive by Ridgway was deflected onto the stumps by Cunningham, and despite Peck's bat being in the crease, she was no longer holding it.

That seemed to sort things out for the spinner: three dots closed out her first over, before two wickets punctuated her second.

Keeper CJ Oastler was key in both instances, but Ridgway was the main culprit in her own dismissal. Her 40-ball stay was a tough one, and the last of several attempts to break the shackles striding down the wicket brought about a stumping. Cunningham's second came just two balls later - the ball rose steeply and kissed the edge of Tilly Fellows' bat, before nestling in the keeper's gloves.

There was no relief for the new Bucks batters, with Immy Sidhu ceding the Norman King End to her sister. She had produced a string of six miserly overs, with just nine runs coming from them - six of which were from the tenth over alone.

And Izzy Sidhu went even better. She did not concede a run until her sixteenth delivery - by that point, she had already coaxed out a drive to Swinburne's hands at mid-off.

That wicket heralded a mini-resistance from the home side, led by number 6 Tegan Stockdale. Mini is definitely appropriate - it added sixteen - but it was something. Stockdale showed some potential, with a four through the covers.

But with Sidhu bowling how she was, a breakthrough was inevitable. Two of them in two balls was less predictable, but even more welcome.

The first was an exceptional piece of work by Board in the field. The spinner fizzed the ball in to Rosie Burton-Pye, who drove it aerially to cover, where it was plucked out of the air. The next delivery, which saw the new batter's stumps splattered, reduced the home side to a very perilous 52-7.

Suffolk's fielding was excellent on all counts. The close fielders were well positioned and happy to throw themselves about, restricting the singles - building the frustration that led to Ridgway's wicket. The twentieth over saw a rare Sidhu ball pierce the ring, as a full toss was heaved out to the square leg boundary, but Liv Hyndman saved three runs with a one-handed catch on the bounce.

Perhaps the most impressive work was done by Oastler, to run out Megs Woodward - who had found the boundary in consecutive Cunningham overs. Stockdale farmed the ball out to Megan Haynes at point, and set off for the run. The throw was slightly wayward, but in one motion the diving keeper collected the ball, redirected it 270Â° and let it fly into the stumps.

At 63-8, both Stockdales - Tegan joined by Caia - were at the crease. The former had accumulated 14 by this point - the team's joint-highest score - but now needed a steady partner, which the latter proved to be for the next seven overs.

The first signs of acceleration came at the end of the 27th over, bowled by Cunningham. Bucks' number 6 waited for the ball to reach her, before slapping it behind point for four. The shot was repeated for two, and again, to make the over worth eight. On a ground with relatively large boundaries, two was the magic number - with five more coming before the innings turned 30.

Cunningham signed off eventually, her ten overs yielding 2-42; Izzy Sidhu's allocation brought 3-13, including four maidens. With a pair of relatively set batters, though, a bowling change was not the worst case scenario.

The Stockdales briefly threatened to test that statement, taking ten from the return of Swinburne. Haynes struck with her second ball of the day - a full ball hitting the home number 9 on the back foot as she shaped for a leg-side slog, and judged lbw - and conceded just one run, in an impressive cameo.

Tegan Stockdale had one last act of defiance: a four through midwicket off Swinburne. But another run-out, this time a mix-up that saw the batters walk to the pavilion rather than scramble to get home, left her stranded on 41.

### Woolpit wizardry wraps up win

104 was the target on the scoreboard. For some, the target was winning early enough to get home in time for England-Slovakia. Either way, Suffolk started their chase with intent, demonstrated by a first-ball two for Izzy Sidhu.

Suffolk also started their chase with some chance of things still going wrong. This was demonstrated by Sidhu's next ball: fired in by Amelia Peck, it jumped up past the opener's edge and she had to walk back.

Emily Cunningham walked to the crease, fresh from a 66-ball 127 for Woolpit in last weekend's Iceni Women's Premier League. That form was evident early on: a boundary in each of the first two overs, paired with four consecutive balls costing two in the third, took Suffolk to 21 - a fifth of the target - in just 18 balls. But again, not risk-free: an aerial chance, albeit tricky, was missed at long-on.

Jess Board, who had scored a half-century in that IWPL match, added eight in the fourth over - with a crisp cross-batted shot through extra cover bringing two before a forceful cut behind square.

The game's position meant a temporary slow-down was no reason to worry for Suffolk - after all, the two runs gained from the sixth over were only just below the initial asking rate. Still, the Bucks bowlers restricted the run-flow effectively, as 21 from 3 turned into 46 from 9.

Their most significant achievement came in the tenth over, bowled by Molly Carter. Cunningham cleared the mid-on fielder to find the boundary off the first ball, but missed out on the second - mistiming her swing to a full toss, which brushed the stumps and raced away. She left the crease slightly more slowly.

Next in was Nat Samuels, and she proved a calm head in a situation requiring not a lot more than that. Progress was steady - far from slow - towards the target, with almost a boundary per over across the unbeaten third-wicket partnership. A wide brought the scores level in the twentieth over, before a Samuels single to mid-on sealed the deal.

The cruise to victory took Suffolk to fourth in their 50-over group, and took them home in time to catch some of the football.

Lucky them.
