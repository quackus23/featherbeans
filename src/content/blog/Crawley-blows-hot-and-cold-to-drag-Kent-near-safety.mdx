title: Crawley blows hot and cold to drag Kent near safety

##

Never one for consistency, Zak Crawley followed up Saturday's first ball duck with a sparkling 238 at Taunton as Somerset tightened their grip, bowling Kent out for 178 in the morning session.

Asked to follow-on still 376 runs in arrears, Kent had a mountain to climb to even reach parity. Just look at Worcestershire at the Kia Oval, set 513 to win: despite fighting valiantly, they were still bundled out with almost four sessions to go in the match.

Not only did Crawley scale the mountain, he ran up it with a freedom belying the state of the match.

Considering how the first innings panned out - seamer Craig Overton having him lbw with the opening delivery - Crawley would have breathed a sigh of relief in tucking his third ball behind square to move off the mark. But that was about where any apprehension ended, with consecutive boundaries off Lewis Gregory's second over getting the England opener into his stride.

Ben Compton, Kent's other opener, may feel it is unfair that his efforts were overshadowed - Compton's 67-ball half-century was actually one delivery quicker than Crawley's. But by that point, his partner was well on his way to 100 - brought up in 135 deliveries with a leg-side slap against Tom Lammonby's bowling.

The opening partnership was eventually ended on 194 by the slightly above part-time spin of Matt Renshaw, having Compton leg-before. Somewhat cruelly, this forced a period of relative circumspection - it would be easy to forget that the visitors were still almost 200 runs behind. Crawley and his captain Daniel Bell-Drummond were measured in adding 82 in the next 22 overs. But having just brought up his 150, the 26-year-old took Gregory for a pair of boundaries in a 13-run over and Kent were running again.

Within 9 overs, Crawley had made it to a 2nd first class double-century. Blitzing the 190s with a pair of imperious sixes - off his England teammate Jack Leach, then the lesser-spotted spin of Andy Umeed - demolished his Kent best of 170.

Watching him lay into Umeed's next over, with two sixes and a four, you could be forgiven for thinking this was an innings of force.

But Crawley is a romantic cricketer. He is beautiful and agonising to watch; you will often see the most glorious drive followed by a horrible nick behind. He will go weeks without a score, before pulling something like this out of the hat. He went years, to the minds of some, not justifying his national selection, before pulling out the most remarkable riposte by top-scoring in England's 2023 Ashes campaign.

Part of his charm, which has seen Brendon McCullum and Ben Stokes back him so vociferously, is also his curse. Crawley feasts for fun on the best bowlers. Look at his piece de resistance at Old Trafford last year. Starc, Hazlewood and Cummins - the most consistent, most technically brilliant pace trio around - were left in tatters, leaking runs at 5 an over, by the most riotous 189 you will ever see.

Bring the level - or pace - down, and he will struggle to adapt. It's why he's thrived against Australia and a Shaheen-led Pakistan, averaging more against them in Tests than any other countries - and why his Test average sat above its County Championship equivalent until Sunday's day out. And of course, it reflects the quality of the Somerset unit. Though missing the experienced Josh Davey, the line was led by England-capped pair of Overton and Gregory. Backing them up was South African seamer Migael Pretorius, who surely has his sights set on higher honours.

With their effectiveness limited due to the toil of two days in the field, Crawley had them lined up at his mercy. If he gets set, he tends to leave some mark on the game - but does score more than his fair share between 40 and 80. Kent needed their star man to go large, and could not have asked him for any more - but more is likely what they needed.

A late burst by Pretorius and Leach saw four Kent wickets fall - including Crawley, finally caught behind off the South African - reducing them from 378-1 to the rather more precarious 409-5. Precarious would not usually be the word for a quadruple century - but in the context of the game, Somerset have their visitors at effectively 43-5 in their second innings. Joe Denly in particular, with a half-century in the first innings, will be vital on Monday if Kent are to get a draw - or even an unlikely victory - from their trip west.

Crawley scaled the summit, but Somerset were there waiting.
