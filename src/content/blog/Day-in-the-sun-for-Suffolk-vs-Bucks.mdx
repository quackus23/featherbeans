##

Suffolk produced the perfect response to defeat against Hertfordshire with a resounding victory over Buckinghamshire at High Wycombe Cricket Club. After setting an imposing first-innings score of 188-1 - the county's highest total of 2024 in all formats - a brilliant bowling effort reduced their hosts to 70 all out.

### Cunningham, Samuels club Suffolk's season-high

It speaks to Suffolk's depth that they can essentially mix up the batting order at will, and Sunday's second match saw a new opening partnership of Laila Hollis and Emily Cunningham. A wide from Alissa Shannon started things off, and Cunningham calmly moved off the mark with two.

Hollis had been hit by a throw while taking a run in the first over, but if it bothered her she did not show it. She greeted bowler Natasha MacBean with a fierce boundary arrowed through the covers, before cutting another past point next ball. Cunningham finished the over off with another four runs through midwicket, as Suffolk moved to 18-0 from just two overs.

Shannon delivered a good riposte, bowling Hollis for ten in her next over. But that would be all for Buckinghamshire to celebrate in the innings.

Nat Samuels joined Cunningham at the crease, and survived a tough chance in the fourth over - a powerful shot bursting through the hands of midwicket. She quickly punished the lapse: a brace of fours down the ground set the tone for what was to come.

Cunningham hit the last ball of the powerplay for four over midwicket, and repeated the shot the next over - hitting the underside of a car. It is a miracle that no windows were broken, or balls lost, given the compact nature of the ground - one side is bordered by the A40, the other the River Wye - and the hitting of the Suffolk pair.

Caia Stockdale's two overs cost her 29, plus a pair of byes, as the second-wicket partnership motored along. By the halfway point in the innings, Suffolk were at 88-1: as many as they had managed overall against Essex three weeks ago.

Amelia Ridgway and Georgie Lloyd had both enjoyed relatively uneventful introductions, with just one boundary across the pair of overs. But Suffolk reached 100 in the thirteenth over, from a shot which looked destined for the boundary before an excellent sliding effort from the Bucks fielder. Undeterred, Samuels finished the over with a four thundered through midwicket, to bring up an imperious half-century.

Not wanting to be overshadowed, Cunningham went on the attack. Lloyd's next over was the target. Three fours in three balls - through long-off, cow corner and deep backward square - took the partnership to 100 and Cunningham within a hit of her own 50.

And that hit went for six, sailing over the long-on boundary into the car park.

A pair of fours to the Suffolk opener in the next over, before three following that, brought the visitors up to 151 - equalling their highest score in all formats this year.

There was a scare to start the 18th over, as Samuels survived a close run-out call when returning for a second. But the status quo was quickly reasserted as she stood back and muscled a boundary through the covers.

Cunningham finally hit a car head-on in the 19th, with a four through cow corner. A six over midwicket took her to 86 with an over to go: a century was still possible.

But after Samuels had brought her partner on strike with four balls to go, the best she could manage was a single. Still, a boundary from Samuels - smacked through extra cover - brought the total up to an imposing 188/1.

### Early wicket avalanche ensures crushing victory

Having set such a daunting total, there was room for more experimentation by Suffolk captain Lauren Swinburne. Laila Hollis, opening the bowling as well as the batting, had never performed either role for Suffolk Women - in fact, before Sunday they had never utilised her spin.

A boundary for Amelia Ridgway got Buckinghamshire off the mark, but Hollis delivered the perfect response: the next ball beat her bat, and keeper CJ Oastler removed the bails before the opener could get her foot down.

Spin was the order of the day, as Immy Sidhu started things at the other end. Another good decision. Amber Drewe and Annie Townsend saw their stumps rattled in consecutive balls, leaving Rosie Lloyd to defend a hat-trick delivery. That she did - but she suffered the same fate in Sidhu's next over.

With the Bucks innings already in tatters at 9-4, Swinburne turned to one of her seamers in Megan Haynes. And again, the decision paid off. Natasha MacBean swept her first ball for four behind square, but the left-hander chopped on next ball. Georgie Lloyd saw off one delivery before being caught at short third by Hollis.

Sidhu's third over brought the dismissal of opener Amelia Peck for 5 - remarkably the seventh wicket to fall, for just 15 runs. Keeper Rosie Burton-Pye walked to the crease, joining number 8 Caia Stockdale, and Suffolk could taste victory.

It's obviously never that simple. The pair rebuilt steadily, taking boundaries from each of the next two overs - the latter lofted down the ground over a leaping Swinburne, as Sidhu finished her allocation with figures of 4-14.

Burton-Pye pirouetted for four past fine leg in Swinburne's first over, before Stockdale put consecutive boundaries through the legside in Emily Cunningham's second. Suffolk remained on top of things in the field, with Cunningham stopping a couple of runs at cover, but another boundary came before Burton-Pye was eventually dismissed by the Suffolk spinner for a run-a-ball 21.

In all, the hosts' 8th wicket partnership lasted just short of 7 overs, and was worth 40. Particularly impressive, given the seven preceding it were worth just 15.

Cunningham's last, sandwiched in between a pair of tight overs from Izzy Sidhu, brought further success. Stockdale's fightback ended on 20, as she stepped down the wicket and was stumped by Oastler. Number 11 Alissa Shannon outscored five of her teammates in one blow through midwicket, but saw her partner - Charlie Mailey - bowled as Amelie Clarke polished things off.

A comfortable victory in every sense took Suffolk to 6th in their group table, with Surrey - led by Amy Gordon, who has dismissed Alyssa Healy and Suzie Bates in professional cricket - only a place higher, and next in their sights.
