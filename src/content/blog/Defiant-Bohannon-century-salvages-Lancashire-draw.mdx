## Defiant Bohannon century salvages Lancashire draw

When I saw that Ollie Pope was coming on to bowl, I looked out of the window. I was shocked to discover that, in fact, fiery comets were not raining down from above. Beasts were not emerging from portals and ravaging cities. Nobody had laid claim on the remnants of a burning Earth, and renamed North America with the latin word for ‘bread'. Somewhat disappointed, I turned back to the considerably more predictable series of events playing out in front of me.

England's number three may well have claimed that an extinction-level event had occurred at the time of his third ball. Pope practically forgot to let go of the ball, and Steven Croft was more than generous in only working the ball through to cover for a single, allowing Josh Bohannon onto strike - immediately hitting a boundary to reach his seventh first-class century.

The use of Pope's “part-time leg-spin”, which was, in reality, first-time leg-spin - the 25-year-old having never professionally bowled before - reflected the loss that Surrey were at. Captain Rory Burns bowled himself for 2.1 overs, to exactly no wicket-taking success. Dom Sibley was not tried, following his nightmare over - quite possibly worse even than Pope's - in the first innings, and neither was lesser-spotted seamer Ryan Patel; otherwise practically every option to Burns was tried to no avail.

The failure to get over the line was not, for the most part, due to Surrey's flaws. Josh Bohannon played spectacularly for his century, and when he eventually departed for 107 he had been in the middle for 234 minutes - exactly what was needed to ensure the champions fell short. The England hopeful's innings included 15 fours, and was achieved at a leisurely but certainly not slow pace: he showed in his first-innings 32 that speed is in his repertoire, in addition to the stability he provided here.

Steven Croft, thirteen years his senior, played a masterfully reserved innings - his unbeaten half-century came at a strike rate below 30. Walking out after both openers had been removed in quick succession, his directive was likely to bat through the day - and that he did, with only 16 of his 56 coming in boundaries. Joined by fellow veteran Dane Vilas after tea, the pair dropped anchor to ensure no late collapses. They successfully made their way through four overs, with Burns agreeing to call time one ball into his 3rd.

### Champions dominate, but ultimately run out of steam

To say there were encouraging signs for Surrey this week would be akin to seeing the crown jewels, and deciding the royal family had maybe a little bit of money.

There had been few doubts over the quality they would bring. Admittedly, they were missing numerous star performers: injury, the IPL and injury at the IPL accounted for the Currans, Jamie Overton, Will Jacks, Jason Roy and Reece Topley, and South African legend Hashim Amla has retired since last year's victorious season. But the depth of their squad, and the quality of their signings in Sean Abbott and Dom Sibley, indicated a strong showing would be on the cards: and so it was.

The obvious highlight was the pair of brilliant innings from England keeper Ben Foakes. 76 and an unbeaten century will theoretically be enough to quell the ever-present rumours about his place in England's side for at least the week. Cameron Steel's classy 141\* in the first innings, his first century for the county, was a ray of sunshine in the gloomy Manchester air.

Most impressive was the apparent ease with which Sean Abbott settled into life in the County Championship. His five wickets in the first innings, on a pitch which offered little-to-no help for any of the bowlers, would be impressive any day; for a man who has played only one previous County Championship match, two years ago, even more so.

As much as Surrey would have enjoyed the win here, a twelve-point draw and a solid performance against last season's closest challengers will suit Rory Burns' side perfectly nicely for the time being.

### Lancashire show promising signs under new leadership

Keaton Jennings made strides towards proving that taking on the captaincy is not ultimately detrimental to his primary function: churning out runs for his Lancashire side.

He led by example in fighting to a gritty first-innings 76, which played a major role in keeping Surrey at arm's length. Without it, Lancashire would perhaps have been asked to follow on: thus giving Surrey ample time to bowl them out once more.

He failed to really get going in the second innings, but it is always seen as a sign of a good team when different people stand up. Josh Bohannon, already highly praised, rose up especially high: he would hope it was high enough to peek over the clouds of selection and wave at Ben Stokes and Brendon McCullum. The birthday boy pushed his case strongly here, and despite the riches England have at their disposal one would be surprised not to see him in the national side before his next anniversary.

The bowling performance was leggy at times, but one leggie in particular helped slow the Feathers down in the second innings. Matt Parkinson picked up a five-fer: no mean feat for a spinner in April, and this pitch was certainly no Ahmedabad. Another on the fringes of the England side, Parkinson will regularly wonder what else he has to do to get into the team: the only answer, it would seem, is what he did on day 3 - repeatedly. Elsewhere in the bowling, new-ball pairing of Tom Bailey and Will Williams looked threatening at the top, although they were prone to losing some rhythm as the days wore on.

The Essex top order may still be desperately hoping to see them leading the attack next week: the other, more Jimmy-Anderson-shaped option would frighten any batter.
