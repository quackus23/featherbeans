## Emphatic win kicks off Suffolk's home campaign

The clouds threatened to derail Suffolk Women's first home game of 2024. Fortunately, Lincolnshire did not. In the sides' first meeting since 2019, the hosts came away with a comfortable seven-wicket victory.

### Tight fielding ties Lincs down

Lauren Swinburne and Megan Haynes ensured that the home side had the better of the first powerplay.

Suffolk started brightly, with stand-in captain Swinburne beating the bat twice in the first over. However, Abigail Hannan responded by lofting the sixth ball over cover for four.

Lillimae Severn put a few well timed shots behind square, before her fun was ended on 8 by Haynes, who drew out a catch in the covers. Soon after, Swinburne got Hannan to slash at a wider ball, putting it into the hands of the back-pedalling Immy Sidhu at point.

By the time ten overs had passed, both Lincolnshire openers were back in the hutch with the score only at 36.

Suffolk's quality only improved with their bowling changes. Following a similar pattern as last time out against Hertfordshire, Emily Cunningham and Immy Sidhu handled matters after the tenth. Bowling the next 20 overs in tandem, they conceded just 36 runs put together.

Cunningham took two wickets in this spell - bowling Sophie Smith, and having Eloise Hall judged lbw. Sidhu, meanwhile, got through her ten overs for just eleven runs.

Izzy Sidhu, taking over her sister's end, chipped in with the wicket of Emily Hill to leave the away side at 82-5. After this dismissal, however, Alicia Shaw took the attack to her and Sophie Hughes.

Shaw, who had come in at number 3, formed the backbone of the Lincolnshire innings. Having steadily built into the forties, she raised her fifty with the first of three consecutive fours off Sidhu's bowling. The onslaught continued with the return of Swinburne - but the bowler had the last laugh, as Shaw was finally caught at mid-on for 64 off 113 balls.

Fortunately for Lincs, captain Lauren Tuffrey took up her mantle. Hitting fours around the ground - from guiding it past backward square, to smacking it through the covers - her unbeaten 35 held up the backend of the innings.

A late brace for Hughes - one caught by each Sidhu - restricted the visitors to 150-8 in their 50 overs. The spinner finished with 2-14 from 7 tidy overs.

Despite a smattering of wides and no balls early on, Suffolk can be proud of a largely disciplined fielding performance. Their fielding in the ring was particularly impressive - and a big reason why the Lincolnshire batters struggled to rotate the strike, let alone get boundaries away.

### Cunningham provides the fireworks

Suffolk needed early intent to stop their target of 151 from becoming steeper. And that is exactly what they had, with Jess Board running a single down to third man off the first ball. Despite not hitting a boundary until the eighth over, they never let the game drift.

Amelie Clarke, Board's opening partner, unfurled a beauty of a cover drive which seemed destined for the boundary, but stopped short. Not long after, she hit an all-run four over midwicket.

All told, the pair reached 44-0 after ten overs - more than twice the powerplay score against Hertfordshire.

Clarke eventually departed for a very well-made 29. She crunched a four through the leg-side, before top-edging Rhiannon Hillman's next ball attempting to repeat the dose. Departing with a third of the chase already completed, the opener can consider it a good day's work.

Izzy Sidhu only continued the good work of the openers. Overtaking Board on her way to 26, the Suffolk number three made the most of being dropped twice - at mid-off, and on the rope - before finally getting caught with the score 100-2.

The bowlers then weaved together a few tricky overs, ensnaring Nat Samuels lbw for 3.

Emily Cunningham, in response, hit their metaphorical web with a cricket bat. Five authoritative fours into the leg-side were accompanied by gentle caresses into the gaps for two. Racing to 30\* in 19 balls, the allrounder denied Board any chance of a fifty - but certainly entertained the crowd.

You have to feel for Board. In batting through the innings, she ran two threes, a four and countless twos. Her 41\* was a brilliantly crafted innings, and deserved a half-century - but more importantly guided Suffolk home within 29 overs.

And as the rain finally arrived, it feels like Suffolk have too.
