title: Ex-Suffolk seamer MacGregor signs Hundred deal
---

##

Essex bowler Esmae MacGregor, who came through the Suffolk age-group system, has earned a wildcard deal in the Hundred with Manchester Originals.

MacGregor, 20, is the leading wicket-taker in the Vitality Blast this season - taking her 21 wickets at an average of 13.38, including the league's best figures of 4-8 against Somerset.

Her performances earned her a nomination for the PCA Player of the Month award in June.

As a result, the seamer will be rubbing shoulders with international stars such as Sophie Ecclestone and Beth Mooney, and form part of a seam attack featuring England speedster Lauren Filer.

England legend Sir Jimmy Anderson was also signed by Manchester Originals in Tuesday's wildcard draft, which was introduced to reward standout performers in the Blast.

MacGregor graduated from Ipswich School in 2022, and played for Suffolk up to under-17 level before making the switch to Essex. She signed her first professional contract with Sunrisers in June 2023, and featured six times as they won the Rachel Heyhoe Flint Trophy last year.
