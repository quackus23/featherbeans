title: Foakes' flourish sets up daunting chase for Lancashire
---

##

When Ben Foakes said last week he was not bothered by the scrutiny his England position had somehow come under, some may have dismissed it as a necessary facade.

Safe to say, one calm 76 and one sparkling 103\* later, it was very much the truth.

His own admission that he is not, “as you'd say, 'Bazball'” would offer scant consolation to Luke Wells as he was dispatched for six in his third over. While his first-innings repair job was a more measured effort, his second-innings masterclass was more free-flowing than most over in the IPL today. Despite just the one maximum, Foakes scattered a litany of fours in amongst his 95 balls to keep his strike rate at 108.

Surrey's morning had begun with more stubborn resistance from the Lancashire tail. Colin de Grandhomme picked up quite a while ahead of where he had left off: the 38 runs he added at almost one-a-ball included one early six off the first over of Dom Sibley's second Surrey stint. Although turning to Sibley suggested perhaps a hint of desperation in Rory Burns' side, they swiftly turned back to starring debutant Sean Abbott - a move rewarded with the fifth of his five wickets, the stubborn Will Williams. Matt Parkinson added only 5 before his resistance waned, landing the Roses on a first innings total of 291 - 153 behind.

Burns still had the follow-on card in his hands; it was no surprise when he opted to insert his side again, owing to the early-season fatigue that was understandably besetting his side. It comes as no coincidence that the Feathers' star performers were those with more recent match practice: Foakes' England appearances, Abbott's recently completed Australian summer and Cameron Steel's Australian grade cricket initiation have all, one imagines, largely influenced Surrey's cutting edge.

Tom Bailey and Williams, the new-ball pairing who had ripped through Surrey's top order so effectively on Thursday, did not quite have such success here. The only wicket between them was that of Sibley: leg-before for a slow 6 on the stroke of lunch. His replacement, Ollie Pope, made a point of demonstrating his luscious inability to comprehend the word 'slow'. A speedy 38 included five fours and a lovely six, calmly played over midwicket. This shot, once more, made use of a brave wander down the wicket - only his inch-perfect timing prevented the wander from extending all the way to the dressing room. The manner in which he did eventually depart was rather spectacular in itself: after a couple of near misses, he was taken by a flying de Grandhomme. Such was the speed of the New Zealander's dive that his trousers appeared to have been left at the airport.

After a re-clothed de Grandhomme bowled an over to Burns which involved a slightly over-exuberant kick of the Dukes ball, Pope's dispatcher Matt Parkinson came on to face new batter Ryan Patel. It was a short stand-off: the spinner looped one past Patel's unprepared defences and onto his stumps. It was perhaps the best of a well-executed, if somewhat expensive, five-fer for a man who would not be blamed for feeling disappointed at a lack of England opportunities: his Test debut came after a mad dash across the country following Jack Leach's concussion last June.

Burns was caught by his former opposite number Dane Vilas in the 35th over, but not before completing a gritty half-century to open the campaign with. Jamie Smith was caught too, before Cameron Steel was bowled in one of the more anti-climactic fifth wickets Parkinson will have claimed: the ball looping through his legs before trickling onto the stumps. By that point, Surrey were firmly in hitting mode: and hit it they did, milking 30 off Luke Wells' four overs. That set up the declaration four balls after Foakes' hundred - waiting until the end of the over proved worthwhile, as Jordan Clark hit his only maximum to post a target of 444.

One would assume that, barring a huge Brendon-and-Ben inspired change of heart on day four, Lancashire's aim would be batting through. Wells took five fours off the 11 overs remaining on day three, perhaps signifying some intent, but captain Keaton Jennings' more reserved 9 seems to signal more realistic expectations. For Surrey, the challenge will be rejuvenating a bowling unit who seemed at times tired in the morning session.

If Abbott's debut continues in the same vein as it began, however, the champions may well be eyeing up victory once more.
