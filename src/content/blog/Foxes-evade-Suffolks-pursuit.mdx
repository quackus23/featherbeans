title: Foxes evade Suffolk's pursuit

##

Suffolk fell 33 runs short against Leicestershire in Stowmarket, as the visitors successfully defended 163. The teams last met in a thrilling tie on this ground last year.

### Cunningham, Sidhus keep a lid on Leicestershire

Suffolk captain Lauren Swinburne won the toss and elected to field, but shook things up by not bowling the first over herself. That honour went to Maddy Reynolds, playing her first game for the county this year.

The Leicestershire openers started quickly, with a series of boundaries taking them to 18-0 from three overs. But Swinburne struck quickly: the fourth over of the innings saw Sophie Bennett's leg stump pinned back.

That wicket signalled a period of calm, as the visitors were restricted to just eight runs across overs 6 to 10. Suffolk's opening bowlers made way - having cost 17 runs each - allowing the usual post-powerplay pair, Immy Sidhu and Emily Cunningham, to enter the attack.

The Foxes were proactive, stealing singles from Sidhu and taking Cunningham's first over for ten. But Sidhu in particular quickly settled into her work, catching a drive in her follow-through to dismiss Beth Wright for a patient 27. Lucy Weston was bowled in her next over, and suddenly the first-class county were three wickets down.

Cunningham at the other end had been a bit expensive, but was eager to join in on the fun. Rebecca Brooker chose the 20th over to go on the attack, picking up consecutive boundaries with a pair of mirrored shots behind square. The visiting captain looked to go for a third, but didn't follow through with the shot and was caught at cover by Nat Samuels for 30.

D'Nica Roff and Flora Davies were the next pair to mount a rebuild. Their partnership of 46 was largely untroubled: they saw off Sidhu without risk and kept the runs flowing at the other end. Megan Haynes replaced Cunningham for a spell, but saw Davies whip the ball to the midwicket boundary. Leicestershire were well-poised at 129-4.

But changes tend to make things happen. The next to try her luck at the pavilion-facing end, Amelie Clarke, punctuated a fiery first over by crashing the ball into Roff's stumps. Izzy Sidhu built the pressure at the other end - she had conceded just three runs before dismissing Davies with a catch off her own bowling.

The seventh-wicket partnership got things briefly moving again, with each batter finding the leg-side boundary. But when Una Paramjothy was run out - called through for a single that was never there - it began a slide of four wickets for seven runs.

Four of these came in one blow to square leg, which spun past the fielder and over the rope. From there on, however, everything went Suffolk's way: each of the last three overs saw the stumps clattered. Cunningham was reintroduced for one successful over, sandwiched between a pair of wickets from Izzy Sidhu.

The first delivery of the 41st over concluded the Leicestershire innings on 162, and brought the spinner's figures to 3-7 from 31 balls. She now averages just 6.7 runs per wicket in five matches for Suffolk this season.

### Series of starts not sufficient for Suffolk

Sophie Singer and Petra Tweedy opened the batting with Suffolk aiming for a calm, steady, incident-free chase. Hannah Francis had other ideas. The left-arm quick, aided by a very enthusiastic appeal from her teammates, had Singer out lbw.

Jess Board at number 3 was quick off the mark, running two down to third man. For the most part, though, scoring was proving tricky. Leicestershire had just one fielder on the boundary, but the bowlers were giving nothing away, so trying to clear the ring aerially was not going to end well.

This meant that the boundaries they did get were impressive shots. Board latched onto a delivery from Paramjothy and sent it flying to the midwicket boundary, before Tweedy guided Francis behind point.

The latter was part of a relatively incident-packed sixth over. It began with a delay, for one of cricket's most boring quirks - a look at the ball. In this instance, there was an actual problem, as the seam had split - but a replacement was found and the game could carry on. Tweedy's innings, however, was cut short: the third delivery was dragged onto her stumps.

The wicket brought Emily Cunningham to the crease. The all-rounder had battered the visiting attack for 85 in last year's tie, and looked good to do the same again. Her opening gambit was imperious, sending a pair of fours down the ground in each of Paramjothy's next two overs.

The last of those was exquisite. She met the delivery on the bounce, and sent it sailing along the ground through extra cover. Things were looking ominous for Leicestershire.

Keeping the runs flowing meant taking on fielders for risky singles, and Suffolk's luck ran out in the twelfth over. Cunningham pushed the ball to Paramjothy, who fired in a throw to the bowler's end and got the last laugh. Suffolk's star was judged to be out of her ground and had to walk back to the pavilion.

Nat Samuels was next in, and next out - although she can hardly be blamed for it. An excellent follow-through catch by D'Nica Roff - one-handed, and low to the ground - reduced the hosts to 49-4, just fourteen overs into the chase.

The Suffolk team is blessed with batters, and so there was no panic when number 6 Amelie Clarke walked out to join Board. The pair had started the season at the top of the order together, after all. Of the 26 runs they added, the highlights were a pair of leg-side boundaries up the hill off consecutive April Herathge overs.

But Roff saw off Board for 23 and Clarke for 16. The former was an lbw call; the latter, an attempted drive which looped off the top edge to cover.

Next to the crease were Immy and Izzy Sidhu. They steered Suffolk past the halfway mark of 82 in the 23rd over, but the latter did not last much longer - caught behind off the bowling of Aimee Colquhoun.

5 wides began the Leicestershire seamer's next over, but she was otherwise miserly. The dearth of runs set the stage for Sophie Lawrence at the other end to unearth another two wickets: Maddy Reynolds was bowled, before Megan Haynes fell to a sharp low catch at midwicket by Colquhoun.

Captain Lauren Swinburne entered the fray at number 11, and performed the role of stubborn tailender excellently. She damaged Lawrence's figures with a pair of lofted leg-side boundaries, which renewed some energy - and maybe even hope - to the Suffolk camp. With 46 runs required from 16 overs, the task was not to dash to the exit but rather to ensure nobody tripped on the way out.

A pair of run-out opportunities came and went for the visitors, with Swinburne grounding her bat on both occasions. But the reintroduction of opening bowler Francis saw the captain's luck run out, courtesy of a simple catch at mid-on.

It didn't match the drama of 2023, but Suffolk put pressure on the first-class county for much of the day. Losing pairs of wickets throughout the match ultimately stopped their challenge from going all the way.
