Suffolk succumbed to a bruising 65-run T20 loss to Surrey at Chipstead CC. Amy Gordon led from the front with a half-century, before Claudie Cooper squashed any Suffolk hopes with a brilliant 4-5.

### Gordon guides Surrey through Sidhu storm

The Sidhu triplets bowled 11 of Suffolk's 20 overs between them, and each accounted for one of the hosts' top three.

Immy Sidhu was trusted with the first over by stand-in captain Amelie Clarke, and quickly repaid the faith. The spinner found some turn, and set up opener Daisy Feast with five dot balls before dismantling her stumps to end the over.

Gordon calmed things down with four through cow corner, in an otherwise impressive opening over from Amber Bradnam, but Suffolk's early dominance was compounded by another tight over from Sidhu.

The turning point came in the sixth over, bowled by captain Clarke. Her opposite number stood tall against the short ball to hit five consecutive boundaries - spread around the ground, from backward square to point. She hit it everywhere except into the trees just inside the midwicket boundary.

Izzy and Poppy Sidhu took over, as Surrey rotated strike to reach the midway point at exactly a run a ball. The former struck in her third over: Kirstie White finding Jess Board at midwicket, ending a fine 62-run partnership.

Megan Haynes' introduction to the attack was not seamless, starting with a Gordon boundary to backward square which was also judged to have been bowled over waist height. South East Stars batter Maddie Blinkhorn-Jones moved off the mark with three, driven beautifully along the ground to deep extra cover.

But the Mildenhall all-rounder struck back in her next over - Blinkhorn-Jones swung, missed and walked back for 5.

Another Mildenhall all-rounder, Sophie Hughes, was welcomed with another blow from Gordon: this a huge six down the hill over cow corner. Bethan Miles started Hughes' next over off in similarly harsh fashion - finding a tree twice, with another boundary in between - but fell to a diving Clarke at mid-off.

Bradnam bowled a beautiful 18th over, costing just two runs, but Gordon and Laxmi Johal cashed in on the 19th - taking eleven from it.

Poppy Sidhu nearly got Johal: her sister Immy was underneath a skier to cow corner, but the ball slipped through her hands to allow a single. The seamer instead had to settle for Gordon - caught next ball by Izzy Sidhu, for 73 off 64 balls.

Gordon's chanceless innings aside, Suffolk did a good job of keeping their hosts at bay - with a target of 133 looking challenging, but not unassailable.

### Cooper quartet keeps Suffolk at bay

Amelie Clarke and Sophie Hughes were tasked with kicking off the Suffolk innings. Surrey elected not to give them any pace to work with - bowling spin at both ends until the thirteenth over.

The move paid off early. Claudie Cooper struck in the second over, bowling Hughes for 2, while Bethan Miles at the other end bowled three overs for three runs.

Suffolk number three Nat Samuels also struggled to get away: shots were either being missed or pounced on by the Surrey fielders. At 10-1 with two balls left in the powerplay, Samuels went for a big shot and fell in the process - Kirstie White taking a comfortable catch.

The introduction of Liv Hyndman added some impetus - Daisy Feast's first over cost eight, punctuated by a boundary lifted over the ring by Hyndman - but she was also accounted for by Cooper, holing out to midwicket. Jess Board looped an easy return catch back to the bowler, to complete a double-wicket maiden - the spinner finished with ludicrous figures of 4-2-5-4.

Captain Clarke was in charge of steadying the ship, and started off well - pulling a Feast full toss to the square leg boundary. But she nailed the next ball to cover, where Amy Gordon took a sharp catch to send Clarke on her way for 10.

That brought together Immy and Izzy Sidhu, and with them came eight overs of relative calm. It was no surprise that the latter stuck around: the left-hander is registered with both counties, and has played in and trained alongside the Surrey team. Though she pulled a boundary through midwicket, and the pair ran well for the 26 they added, the rate was already spiralling and it was not coming down. Gordon bowled her four overs in this period, for just 10 runs.

The pace of Charlotte Lambert was a reprieve from the spin barrage, but didn't prove any friendlier. She claimed Izzy Sidhu's wicket in her third over, the batter pulling aerially to deep square leg and falling to a fabulous horizontal catch by Robyn Bentley.

Charlotte Stubbs was introduced for the 18th over, and cost nine runs - the highlight being another pull through midwicket, this time for Immy Sidhu. Megan Haynes, at number eight, looked good in her brief cameo - scoring 7 from 6.

But Miles returned for the 20th, and closed things out in style for the home team. Sidhu was excellently caught for 15 off the penultimate ball - fittingly by Cooper, who ran around to deep midwicket and took the catch in front of her face. Keeper CJ Oastler came in for the last ball and didn't die wondering, falling lbw to round out Miles' figures of 2-9 and Surrey's 65-run victory.
