title: Herts too hot to handle for Suffolk
---

##

Suffolk's first game of matchday two in the County T20 competition came against Hertfordshire in High Wycombe. The Home County, who had beaten Suffolk in a 50-over match back in April, had opened the day with a comfortable nine-wicket win over hosts Buckinghamshire and were looking to repeat the dose.

### Sidhu squeeze too late for Kemp quality

Amelia Kemp had given Herts a strong start in the season opener at Letchworth, and today was no different as she crunched Suffolk captain Lauren Swinburne for a first-ball 4. Her opening partner, Gemma Marriott, copied the act. Suffolk were already fearing the worst.

But Marriott, who had earlier crushed Bucks with an unbeaten 58, saw her next ball fly into the hands of Laila Hollis at mid-off. Swinburne's decision to bowl first was vindicated, and Suffolk had hope.

The new batter, Elsa Barnfather, did her bit to dampen their spirits: her boundary meant Herts had 13 runs as Megan Haynes started proceedings at the other end.

The second over brought just two runs off the bat, albeit with a sprinkling of wides. Further encouragement came as Swinburne's return enticed a wild miscue from Kemp. A short lbw appeal against Barnfather came in Haynes' second.

But like that appeal was waved away, Suffolk's attempts to split up the second partnership were calmly dismissed by the pair.

The introduction of spinners Immy Sidhu and Emily Cunningham couldn't stop the runs. Usually so miserly through the middle, the pair went for 38 and 39 respectively.

Kemp looked particularly imperious behind square. She moved onto 49 with a boundary, swept through deep backward square - one of many. She looked just as comfortable on the other side of the wicket, cutting several boundaries through point.

In front of the wicket was an option too: the 10th over, bowled by Cunningham, saw a four shovelled over mid-on, followed by a six through the covers.

Basically, it didn't matter where the fielders were: if Kemp hit it, it would find a gap.

Izzy Sidhu recognised this, and ensured she was ready for if Kemp did not hit it. From the last ball of her second over, the partnership was finally broken: the Herts opener walked back with 72 from 48 to her name.

The second wicket partnership had reached 100 the over before, brought up from 63 balls thanks to a four through cow corner by Barnfather.

The next few overs were challenging for Hertfordshire. Izzy Sidhu's third and fourth both brought wickets: captain Kezia Hassall, and Rebecca Tyson, for a run apiece.

Tyson had already received some good fortune. The over sandwiched between had seen the introduction of Amelie Clarke, and Tyson's bat was beaten several times - including one which brought an appeal for caught behind, having clipped the stumps on the way through.

Clarke's 18th had mixed results. New batter Charlotte Banks was run out for 1, attempting a non-existent single. However, a boundary, ramped over fine leg, brought up Barnfather's half-century from 38 balls.

Barnfather, who could naturally feel underappreciated so far in this report, had held the innings together nicely since Kemp's departure. And, excluding the run-out, she ran well in the closing stages - her team scoring from 17 of the last 20 legal balls.

Two of those three, though, were wickets: the run-out joined by Ella Phillips losing her stumps to Immy Sidhu.

In all, Hertfordshire's 168/6 was a perfectly good score - but Suffolk could be commended for reining it in, on a scorching afternoon. Izzy Sidhu's 3-17 was the standout contribution, but all the way through to 12th man Amber Bradnam running drinks on, the attitude remained positive.

### Double Phillips battery subdues Suffolk reply

Amelie Clarke and Olivia Locke have certainly faced worse opening bowlers than Charley Phillips.

Frankly, anyone able to convince their captain to put in multiple slips deserves respect - even if it is mostly to look fancy.

But Phillips knew what she was doing. The 21-year-old, officially part of the Sunrisers first team squad for this season, looked dangerous from the start: despite a few wides, including one which flew past everyone down to the boundary, not a single run came off the bat in the first over. Had the slips spooked the openers into extreme caution, or was the bowling just really good?

The sight of Clarke's leg stump flying across the ground in the third over answered that question pretty emphatically.

New Zealander Emily Cunningham strode to the crease at 3, and escaped Phillips' assault with a calm single. Knowing that one bowler was going to be extremely difficult to attack, she set about taking down the other.

Rebecca Tyson's first over had cost just one - but cricket changes quickly, and so did Tyson's fortunes. The 15 runs scored from her second over eclipsed the 12 taken off her entire ten-over spell in the season opener. Cunningham drove a four down the ground, before sweeping another through square leg; Locke moved off the mark with a four through long-off.

Another Charley Phillips over passed with neither consequence nor runs, before the sixth of the innings saw the introduction of her twin sister. The spin of Ella initially fared slightly worse than the pace of Charley: her first ball was lifted back over her head by Locke.

Suffolk would have been delighted by Hertfordshire's decision to bowl out Charley Phillips in the eighth over. And five balls in, they may have relaxed, believing they had seen off this particular threat for no further loss.

But one of the joys of being a bowler is always getting to go again, and Phillips' last ball saw Cunningham trapped lbw for 13.

If that wasn't enough, replacing her was Gemma Marriott - who had taken 3-20 against Bucks, in addition to her half-century. Nevertheless, Locke and new batter Nat Samuels survived four overs together - their 21 the second highest partnership of the innings, after Locke and Cunningham.

Locke in particular was having some success down the ground, with the majority of her runs scored between long-on and long-off.

Ella Phillips' last over started well enough for Suffolk, with Samuels guiding a four through cow corner. But Locke was bowled soon after, ending her vigil of 20 from 40 and giving Phillips her first wicket.

Laila Hollis saw off the last three balls in style. Her first ball was guided down to third man for two, before she rocked back and smashed the ball uppishly past deep backward square.

A pair of cover drives for two by Samuels in Marriott's next over continued the momentum, before the introduction of Chloe Eayrs. Hollis herself took consecutive twos, before sending an aerial pull to midwicket.

But Marriott was there again. The calmness with which she ran around and picked the ball out of the air belied how close it was to sailing over the rope.

The next to flash in the pan was Jess Board. Eayrs' next over was the second in the innings to cost 15 - an odd coincidence given just three went for more than 7.

Board's two boundaries in the over were in opposite directions: one behind square on the leg-side, one in front on the off-side. Both good shots, both four runs. Samuels dispatched another past wide long-off to round off a good over - albeit one already behind the climbing required run-rate.

The introduction of Saskia Heard saw the end of their partnership - admittedly through coincidence more than anything. After Samuels played a shot to cover and ran a risk-free single, a risk-full second was attempted - and she was run out for 20.

Board's innings ended on 19 in the 18th over: caught diving forward at point by Barnfather. Megan Haynes then provided some entertainment as the game drew to a close, with a brace of fours through long-on and cover topping up Suffolk's 111/6.

It wasn't enough to stop a 57-run defeat, but Suffolk headed into their second game of the day on a positive note.
