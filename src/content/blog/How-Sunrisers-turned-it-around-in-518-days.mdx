title: How Sunrisers turned it around in 518 days

##

966 days. On the morning of April 22, 2023, 966 days on from their first match, Sunrisers were preparing to start their fourth season of existence in the Rachel Heyhoe Flint Trophy. It might be too strong to say they were harbouring hopes of a first ever 50-over win: their opponents, Southern Vipers, had contested all three finals and won two of them. Sunrisers, meanwhile, had two points to their name - ever - courtesy of a September 2022 washout in Northampton.

But they won, and in some style - bowling their hosts out in 35 overs. 126 runs is a big margin regardless, but against a side with England regulars and domestic pedigree coming out of their ears, the statement echoed further. Sunrisers were different now.

Fourth place, and 32 points represented a hugely successful season. Frankly, anything above dead last would have been an improvement, so to come within four points of a first knockout appearance meant everything was trending in the right direction. Vipers went on to win the title once more, cementing their dynasty - but not without suffering another loss to Sunrisers in July.

All this considered, it was fitting that the same fixture brought 2024's regular season to an end. Vipers were comfortably qualified for the semi-finals anyway, so the stage was set for their visitors to finally bring knockout cricket to the east of England.

Rain, and former teammate Naomi Dattani, threatened to derail the occasion but by the end of a shortened affair, Sunrisers were home and dry. A five-run win - and a performance more dominant than that suggests, led by Macleod and Griffith fifties - secured a second consecutive 50-over double over Charlotte Edwards' team. Across the five year domestic cycle, nobody else beat Vipers at home in this format - Sunrisers made a habit of it.

So, to Leeds. Northern Diamonds had a wonderful final campaign - topping the table - and a plethora of international stars to offset the loss of captain Hollie Armitage to national duty.

Lauren Winfield-Hill did not have her best day, restrained in the first instance by an incisive opening burst from Kate Coppack (1-29) and Eva Gray (2-52). Emma Marlow fought through well, but her 62 was gritty rather than fluent - and only backed up towards its end by Sterre Kalis' 49. Phoebe Turner instead provided the danger: 32\* from 15, batting at 9, hauled the home side up to a tricky 232.

Tricky. Funny. Sunrisers captain Grace Scrivens fought through the toughest part, laying a platform with a composed 56. Cordelia Griffith and Jodi Grewcock picked up the mantle when she fell, scoring 68 and 63\* to sweep home with 6 overs and 7 wickets to spare. The 2022 champions fought well, but in truth Sunrisers looked destined to reach the showpiece from the moment Winfield-Hill was caught tamely off Abtaha Maqsood.

Then, to the final final. The moment that has been built up to for five years. For South East Stars too, who had never won this competition - they were the first victors of the Charlotte Edwards Cup in 2021, but adding a 50-over title to round off the regional era would be the pinnacle.

There's a cliche in cricket: a heavily anticipated first ball going horribly wrong, signalling a catastrophic failure. Think Steve Harmison and his wide to start the 2006/07 Ashes. As Mady Villiers opened Saturday's game with a leg-stump drag-down, easily dispatched by Bryony Smith for four, the thought crossed my mind.

Enter Kate Coppack. Within five minutes, the first ball was long forgotten: replaced by the sight of splattered stumps. Both Alexa Stonehouse and newly-minted England international Paige Schofield were sent packing in a match-defining second over.

Villiers produced a razor-sharp piece of fielding to send back Bryony Smith, and returned at the end to dismiss Alice Davidson-Richards for a battling 93 to limit the Stars to 212. But Coppack's career-best contribution in particular, of 4-27 from her ten overs, will live long in the memory of everyone associated with this Sunrisers side.

To use another cliche, Stars needed early wickets. Jo Gardner's first-ball duck, in the second over of the innings, ticked that box - but Sunrisers again danced around the danger. Cordelia Griffith continued her sublime run of form - racing to 40 in just 36 balls.

Kalea Moore slowed things down, having Griffith caught at cover for 57, but she could not prise out captain Scrivens. The rain came at 25 overs, with Sunrisers sitting pretty at 121-3, and never let up.

And so, on the 1484th and final day of their existence, the rain poured and the Sunrisers shone.
