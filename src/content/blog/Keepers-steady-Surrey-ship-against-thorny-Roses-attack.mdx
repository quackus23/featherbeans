## Keepers steady Surrey ship against thorny Roses attack

The main question in the build-up to this County Championship season has been around the influence that England's bold new Test style will have on its feeder competition.

One could be forgiven, on a wet Manchester morning, for thinking that the answer was none. With no strike rates exceeding 63, the day proved former English captain Sir Alastair Cook's point: it is not so simple to translate exhilarating Test cricket to four rainy days in Lancashire.

The champions' opening partnership - their captain, Rory Burns, alongside Dom Sibley making his second debut for the county - read like a roll call at the English Home of Discarded Test Openers. Both made it to just one off of their first 13 balls. From there, however, the pair had contrasting fortunes. For Burns, his thirteenth proved to be his last; Sibley went on to make a respectable 69-ball 35 before edging behind off Lancashire's overseas debutant, the now mullet-less Colin de Grandhomme.

Surrey's England number three, Ollie Pope, tried his best to drag the match towards the 'Bazball' way. The very first ball he faced was chased somewhat unnecessarily down the pitch - one of the less successful aspects of his rejuvenation under the tutelage of Ben and Brendon. Despite the risk the tactic posed to my heart rate, Pope replicated the shot with more success only three balls further into his innings, dispatching Will Williams down through midwicket for three runs. He could only add ten more, however, before he was taken lbw by Williams' new ball partner, Bailey.

Williams took Ryan Patel leg before wicket for three in the 16th over, to add to his earlier scalp of Burns. That brought England's wicketkeeper, Ben Foakes, to the crease; he was joined on the cusp of lunch by his Surrey understudy, Jamie Smith, after Sibley fell. The pair negotiated a couple of tricky overs to reach the break at 85-4.

The second session of the day was when the rebuilding job properly began. Despite a 25-ball head start for Foakes, it was the younger of the two keepers who reached his half-century first: a flick through the leg side brought Smith to 53 after facing 84 balls. He would only add one more before falling to Bailey, the keeper George Bell taking his third catch behind the stumps of the day. Still, the 87-run partnership had taken Surrey from a faltering start to a more stable position, with 164 on the scoreboard after 53 overs. 

The American all-rounder Cameron Steel made his way out to the middle, and made 45 of his 75-run stand with the English national. Despite only striking 9 boundaries on his way to an unbeaten 86, he played a key role in taking the run rate from a miserly 3 to a slightly-less-so 3.5 by the close. He played second fiddle while the keeper was at the crease, then took up Foakes' usual role of guiding the lower order after his dismissal.

Steel and Jordan Clark took the match to the Lancashire attack leading up to the 80th over: the introduction of the new ball. Lukes Wells and Wood struggled somewhat, but the tactic of holding back Tom Bailey's reintroduction seemed to pay dividends when he took his third wicket, that of Clark, in the 83rd. If anything, though, this seemed to intensify the onslaught: Steel added an unbeaten 62-run partnership with Sean Abbott before the close. Australian debutant Abbott smoked 3 fours and a six in his contribution of 34 not out, as Surrey closed on 340-7. 

### Foakes improves England credentials: but did he need to?

Ben Foakes has, in recent weeks, had his place in the Test side under threat. This is, of course, despite no first-class cricket being played by Englishmen since February - that being a historic two-test series in which Foakes was the fourth-highest run scorer. If that seems unfair to you, you would not be alone. 

Perhaps the least flashy name in a Test side filled with legendary English players, it would not be difficult to assume that Foakes would have to make way for the impending Jonny Bairstow. Although not quite as capable a gloveman, the Yorkshireman would fill the role quite suitably and it cannot be argued that his performances don't warrant a place in the team. If director of men's cricket Rob Key and new chief selector Luke Wright shared this view before Thursday's play, they may well be glad they turned out on a cold Old Trafford day: Foakes' maturity helped avert what appeared to be a certain Surrey collapse.

Another who played a key role in this rescue, Jamie Smith, will surely be on England's radar for the future. After scoring a sublime 126 over the winter on Lions duty, he yet again demonstrated his potential to follow in his colleague's footsteps, and earn his full cap. On a day where Finlay Bean of Yorkshire scored his maiden first-class century, at a very healthy run-rate, the future for England looked bright - even if the sky did not. 

### Lancashire fail to capitalise on golden morning

Last year's championship runners-up would have been licking their lips in delight watching Tom Bailey and Will Williams swinging the ball this morning. It did not take long to draw the obvious parallels to Lancashire's living legend, Jimmy Anderson, and while these two do not have quite his quality or credentials they did have Surrey on the ropes. 

Somewhat paradoxically, neither of Lancashire's England-capped bowlers had nearly as much success. While he did pick up the vital wicket of Foakes, Luke Wood endured a tough afternoon and evening, going at 4.67 runs per over. The game's trajectory away from the Roses' control reached a head between Foakes' dismissal and the new ball, six overs later. Wood, Wells and Matt Parkinson shared these overs, for very little success. Just the one wicket in the afternoon session, and two in the evening, suggested that Bailey and Williams were the only ones who got any sort of rhythm.

The obvious factor that may well have led to this inconsistency was the captaincy change. Dane Vilas stepped down after last year, allowing another resident of the Discarded Openers' Home to take it up in Keaton Jennings. While his batting successes in the championship last year were undeniable, it was not difficult to anticipate growing pains with the new job and those were best demonstrated today. Jennings bowled neither himself nor Steven Croft: certainly not a necessity, but perhaps an injection of freshness into an attack which needed some. 

The day certainly was not an awful start to Jennings' reign. However, as Abbott lifted Wood over the boundary in the final over, you would not blame him for feeling like a chance had been wasted.
