One upside to any bad performance is how easy it is to spot the silver lining.

Glancing through the scorecard for England Lions' first innings effort against South Africa A, the score that sticks out isn't that of recently-capped skipper Dan Mousley, or regular County Championship run-maker James Rew. It's not the four runs Rocky Flintoff added - although his name will always attract the most attention. Today, Surrey seamer Tom Lawes stole the headlines with a rapid 48 at number 8, which dragged the young side up from the inescapable depths of 72-7 to - let's not get ahead of ourselves - a less-than-adequate 154.

In 38 balls spent almost entirely in the company of fellow seamer Zaman Akhter, Lawes delivered a reminder of what first brought him to the world's attention. This is referring to the 2022 One-Day Cup, so of course 'the world' means me and the three other people who watched Surrey fall to 7th place in group A.

Looking back on it, Lawes didn't have a very tangible impact with the bat in that tournament - three of his half-centuries came in heavy defeats, and the fourth in a landslide victory. Nor has he since: 58 against Durham in September was just his second half-century in 25 first-class matches. In those, of course, he has barely batted above 9 - such is Surrey's depth.

But his ability to consistently stand up as a 19-year-old, outperforming a number of Surrey's Championship-winning stars, sent a message. A standalone 63-ball 75 at Notts, again trying to salvage his team's innings, had a similar air of authority to today's effort.

Things have moved on since then, and Lawes - at 21 - was the second-oldest in the Lions' top eight today. That speaks to the nature of this trip: a camp focused on young fast-bowling talent. As talented as the batters Freddie Flintoff brought along are, it feels that the batting - or lack thereof, today - is not going to be of much concern.

Lawes will, therefore, be happy that he has more than made an impression with his bowling as well. Two-time SA20 winner Jordan Hermann was seen off by a corker of an opening delivery, which bounced off a length and flew to Rew behind the stumps. Tshepang Dithole was then rushed into chipping an easy catch to short midwicket.

He kept things tight for 4-38, adding the last two wickets of the innings on the second morning. But that impact was probably most strongly felt through his absence, when it came to South Africa's second batting effort. With the Lions opting to completely change their attack, Hermann flew to an unbeaten 115 off just 112 balls. The tourists are now 328 runs behind, with six wickets left to take. They sorely missed Lawes' consistency and control, with all of their seamers conceding at least three and a half runs per over.

Consistency is one thing which sets Lawes apart. Not the tallest, and not the quickest, he doesn't seem to quite fit the attributes-first methodology that England are all about these days - yet this is his second Lions tour of the year, and he looks bound for a flight to Australia later this winter.

Growing up in the shadow of Kemar Roach and Dan Worrall, Lawes has had to work for his opportunities. In seven Championship matches in 2024, he opened the bowling just twice - each time, tasked with replacing the peerless Worrall on thankless surfaces. With such impeccable footsteps to follow in - and behind a supporting cast including Gus Atkinson, Sam Curran, Jordan Clark and Jamie Overton - Lawes would always be the one singled out for a hard time. To emerge from that kind of summer with his reputation enhanced, if without the stats to properly reflect it, shows that he does have something to be interested in.

So maybe it's not the second coming of Jimmy Anderson. There's probably not much to get excited about in the short term - Lawes is less likely to feature for England in next year's Ashes than the Australian Worrall. But a 21-year-old seam-bowling all-rounder getting a reputation for standing up, and standing out? That's a reasonable silver lining.
