## Light at the end of the tunnel for Sunrisers

There aren't many labels lower than 'the worst'. But that's what Sunrisers head coach Andy Tennant was faced with at the start of the 2023 season, three years - and no wins - into the new era of the English women's game.

In a sense, it must have been liberating. A solitary win would have come as progress; moving off the foot of the table, a genuine success. The opening win against perennial champions Southern Vipers was certainly not in the script, but that was undoubtedly the single event which turned perceptions around as they finished just one win away from the play-offs.

Now for the first time, Tennant's side enter a campaign with genuine expectation. But there are expectations, and then there is being top of the table after four matches.

### Growing the squad, but not too much

Perhaps the most impressive element of Sunrisers' turnaround is how little they have looked outside of their region. Eva Gray is the only member of the main squad to have featured for a different regional team. And while the presence of former South African captain Dané van Niekerk certainly helped to drive last season's late charge, that initial win came before she was signed.

Three of last Saturday's XI have graduated through the academy over the last couple of years. New captain Grace Scrivens was just 16 when she played in their first ever match. Her first captain, Amara Carr, is the oldest player to feature for them this year - at just 30 years and two weeks.

Re-signing van Niekerk seems like a shrewd bit of business: a calming presence, experienced but far from past it, to hold the squad - and an innings - together. She is already a part of the ecosystem, having captained after Kelly Castle stood down last year, so will have no trouble settling back in.

There's a metaphor in here somewhere about planting flowers, letting them struggle through and watching them blossom into a title-winning garden.

Regardless of how fair it is, the lack of England regulars does also contribute to the continuity of the squad. Mady Villiers, with 17 caps, is the only full English international in the team - but she has not been needed since 2021.

A helpful contrast here is one of their victims, The Blaze. In this fixture a year ago, their top order collapsed to 22-4. But they had Tammy Beaumont. Her 64 dragged The Blaze out of The Very Big Hole that they had fallen into, to a three wicket victory. This time around, their inexperienced batting line-up crumbled and kept crumbling.

There is no doubt that on their day, The Blaze are a very good side. And Beaumont is a very good player, so it is no shame or surprise that they won on five of her six Rachael Heyhoe Flint Trophy appearances in 2023. But the fact that that fell to 3 wins in 7 when she was missing speaks to how important she has always been at the top of the order.

Also missing the Bryce sisters - away with Scotland - and Georgie Boyce, it is no shock that The Blaze have struggled this year, languishing at the foot of the table.

Sunrisers, on the contrary, have rarely had to contend with international duties. The notable exception, of course, is Abtaha Maqsood - currently enjoying the World Cup Qualifiers alongside the Bryces. But their bowling has always had more depth than their batting; what could certainly prove detrimental to their hopes this year would be the much-anticipated England debut of Grace Scrivens.

While nobody in the region would begrudge their captain what would be a well-deserved first cap, they may be hoping for her to avoid selection for the New Zealand series in particular - otherwise, she could miss up to four matches.

### What do I do with all of these bowlers?

You know you're doing well when losing three of your regular bowlers doesn't result in catastrophe. Eva Gray, Kelly Castle and Maqsood would have barely bowled an over between them, even if they had been available, such has been the success of the Sunrisers' bowlers.

Against The Blaze and Western Storm this year, Sunrisers took all 20 available wickets for just 201 runs. Just three of the overs bowled came from outside of their main quartet, and even those yielded a wicket. Nicola Hancock's six wickets were taken at an absolutely ludicrous average of 5.83.

Their most recent outing, against Central Sparks, was their most controlled showing. Kate Coppack and Hancock opened the bowling in their usual reliable manner, bowling all ten powerplay overs for just 13 runs. They were handsomely rewarded in the end, with 3 wickets each, while Jo Gardner, Jodi Grewcock and Esmae MacGregor all chipped in.

The aberration of the second match, in which they conceded 292/5 against Thunder, shouldn't detract from the wondrous displays either side. While admittedly 'they were better' doesn't hold water for teams competing to be the best, Katie Mack - of Essex a few years ago - and Fi Morris proved too good on the day.

Even in the face of that carnage, Grewcock stood tall. With 1-40 from 10 overs, she can claim to have done her bit - and across the course of this season she has done a lot more than just that. With 6 wickets at an economy rate of 3.26, the 19-year-old has backed up the opening bowlers brilliantly and made Maqsood's absence seem irrelevant. Along with batting at number four in 3 tricky chases, and a feisty 38 in the face of Thunder's dominance, she has provided wonderful balance to the team.

Her early-season spin twin has been Mady Villiers - not shocking when you consider her international average of 17.28. Another batting in the top six, her experience - perfectly fair to say, even at only 25 - can only help Grewcock out.

Experience is a very good word for the seamers. Coppack has been handy as ever - her opening bursts not giving much away. But new overseas signing Hancock has been nothing short of incredible. 10 wickets at 12.40 were exactly what Andy Tennant was looking for when he signed the Australian. Only around for the first six games, she is already having an impact off the field as well: Castle said on the livestream against Blaze that Eva Gray had already picked up several tips. Gray, herself a recent England A international, will be doing her best to make up for Hancock's absence later in the year.

It speaks to the riches at Scrivens' disposal that genuine allrounder Jo Gardner watched over 142 overs from the field before bowling - and took a wicket in her second over. Yet to make her debut is the exciting Charley Phillips, while Amu Surenkumar is coming off of an England U19 tour with Grewcock.

### Clear-visioned captaincy

In the name of continuity, it is fitting that Grace Scrivens was named club captain for 2024. Nothing else would bookend the five year story of Sunrisers quite so nicely. From the first match as a 16-year-old, to the team's most iconic talisman as a 20-year-old when she will lead them out for their last.

Of course, romance won't win you cricket matches - perhaps why the world decided to make the main protagonist pretty damn good at that too. On Wednesday, a sparkling unbeaten 118 carried her team through a potentially tough chase. For the third time this season. Having not lost her wicket in a chase all season, she leads the run charts with an incomprehensible average of 236.

Sunrisers' batting can definitely be considered their weaker suit, historically relying heavily on Scrivens. She is clearly thriving under that pressure, so there is nothing suggesting she won't cope with the captaincy just as well.

Anyway, you would always welcome an England captain to lead your team. Scrivens did a wonderful job in 2023's U19 World Cup, leading her team to the final - and considering the 164 senior caps in India's line-up, that can only be considered a massive success.

The manner in which they got to the final - defending an impossible 99 to win by three runs, in surely one of the best “unofficial" Ashes clashes of all time - will live long in the memory. Being bowled out for 99 again will not be on her bucket list, but the challenge of leading an unfancied team to great things is nothing new.

When the sun rose on this era of women's cricket, the Sunrisers were left in the dark. But as it sets, they may well be one of its brightest lights.
