When things aren't quite right in life, we often look at what we can change. A bold haircut, a flashy new car or a move to Australia.

The ECB's decision to relocate, moving away from the reliable leadership of Heather Knight, is a drastic one. The game, and country, are barely recognisable from the start of her nine-year reign. Eighteen days into it came the Brexit referendum. 55 days in, the first Kia Super League game. She's seen off more prime ministers than you can shake a lettuce at.

In that time, Knight has overseen five Ashes series. Two encouraging - three miserable - none won. Does that responsibility lie on the captain? 1165 runs at 37.58 and a widely respected cricketing brain would suggest otherwise.

But equally, for such a long tenure to become a dynasty, you'll need more than one trophy. In that sense, maybe the tame exit from October's T20 World Cup prompted England's shakeup just as much as another disappointing Ashes. On the field, the Knight era was one of success where expected, and little else.

Off it, however, women's cricket in England has progressed at an unprecedented rate - and the England captain, the face of it all, took it all in her stride. From Leicester in 2016, to the MCG in 2025 - Knight never looked overawed, or out of place.

Her replacement, then, will need authority on both sides of the boundary, to keep breaking new ground. Knight has done so much to shoulder that burden over the years - whoever takes over will likely need to lean on her for years to come.

Nat Sciver-Brunt is the only player who can hold a candle to Knight's experience. She has filled in over the years, although with limited success - the 2022 Commonwealth Games were a disappointment, and October's implosion against the West Indies happened under her temporary watch. As England's best player - and, along with Knight, only stable batter - perhaps now is not the time to burden her with the captaincy.

Amy Jones is another with prior experience standing in as captain, albeit when called upon in 2022 she said that the role didn't come naturally to her. Three years since as part of the leadership group may have changed that, though. The bigger issue, after a disappointing Ashes, may be holding on to her wicket-keeping spot - young talents Bess Heath and Seren Smale are both poised to be part of England's regeneration.

Also in the mix is Sophie Ecclestone - she has been undroppable for several years already, and at 25 has many left in her. But her role in the recent debate around team culture - allegedly refusing an interview with ex-teammate Alex Hartley - has left a sour taste in the mouth for some.

The fourth contender is my personal pick. Charlie Dean has quietly become an integral part of this England side, with room for a more prominent role. Her bowling has always been in the shadow of Ecclestone, but both have remarkable (and surprisingly similar) averages in each white-ball format. Dean has an ODI strike rate of a wicket every 27 balls - beating Ecclestone's 32.

Her batting has always felt under-utilised by England. Dean is forging a reputation of being calm at the crease. The most famous example of this was at Lord's in 2022, when a fabulous rearguard to save the game from number nine was upended by a Mankad. Last year, an unbeaten 42 helped Jones to manage a tricky chase against New Zealand. She has the potential to bat higher, particularly in ODIs, and prevent the collapses rather than just mitigating the damage.

As for the captaincy: she is another who has deputised for Knight. At just 21, she filled in for a season at London Spirit - things didn't work out, but the fact she was chosen to do the job over the likes of Sophie Luff and Beth Mooney tells you what Knight saw in her. Part of Spirit's leadership group, Dean has had years to pick Knight's brain. Whether it's now or in the future, she will captain England.

The most persistent problem that England have is, of course, nothing to do with Knight's leadership. The batting lineup almost always look like rabbits in the headlights when faced with any form of spin. Even a rabbit - or similarly, Lauren Bell at the end of the 2025 Ashes Test - would have a better record at keeping out Alana King and Ash Gardner.

They've tried to address it. After a dismal home T20 loss to Sri Lanka, Jon Lewis took a group on a training camp aimed at playing spin - that same group of players just gave up 40 wickets, at an average of 12.3, in seven games down under.

It's a well documented issue - English conditions don't suit spin, so English players don't suit spinning conditions.

The one ground which bucks this trend slightly is Chelmsford - since the arrival of Simon Harmer in 2017, the surfaces have generally been more conducive to spin. Now the permanent home of Essex Women, expect spin all-rounders Grace Scrivens and Jodi Grewcock - both on the England A tour to Australia - to press their cases.

In the space of two days, England have turfed out a head coach and captain to go with the old domestic system.

Is it the right call? That remains to be seen. But given English cricket can't emigrate to Bondi or Coogee, maybe it was the only call.
