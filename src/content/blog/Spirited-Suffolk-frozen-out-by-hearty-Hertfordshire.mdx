# Spirited Suffolk frozen out by hearty Hertfordshire

The final county season before the restructuring of the women's game began on a frosty morning in Letchworth. Though it has been an issue more often discussed amongst the first-class counties, both Suffolk and Hertfordshire will be hoping for strong campaigns to back their bids for entry into Tier 2 of the soon-to-be-built pyramid.

### Phillips defies death by spin

The away side certainly started well enough, with a probing opening spell from Lauren Swinburne backed up by the economical Megan Haynes, on debut. Herts opener Amelia Kemp weathered the storm, to hit four boundaries - including a leg-side six off Swinburne - on her way to 30. Captain Kezia Hassall, on the contrary, had only managed 4 off 20 by the time spinner Immy Sidhu came on for the last over of the powerplay.

The Kemp-fuelled opening partnership ended on 43 with the introduction of Kiwi spinner Emily Cunningham. However, Gemma Marriott denied the Suffolk bowlers any respite. Four fours and a six within seven overs formed the basis of her 35-ball 42, before she offered up a somewhat disappointing return catch for Cunningham.

Despite the slightly tame dismissal, it was a just reward for the generally tight bowling of Cunningham and Sidhu. The pair bowled their full quotas in tandem, returning figures of 20-1-94-4. As much as the coaches had planned for the spinners to "bore the batters to death", it certainly made entertaining viewing for the travelling Suffolk fans.

If that wasn't enough, the pair each contributed their own direct-hit run-outs in the same period - Mabel Reid (2 from 6) and Millie Dyer (1 from 10) suffering this fate to leave the hosts wobbling on 109-6. As Rebecca Tyson and Ella Phillips saw off two final Sidhu overs, the fielders may have let themselves dream of the warmth.

What followed was a steady, rather than spectacular, 58-run partnership from the lower order batters. Tyson struck three fours on her way to a 38-ball 25, before being caught by Poppy Sidhu. Chloe Eayrs and Hayley Arrol then stuck around, for 13 and 23 balls respectively, to allow Phillips to finish off the dish. By the time she finally fell for 65, she had ensured that what could've been a lacklustre total became competitive.

While Swinburne and spinner Sophie Hughes split the last four wickets between them, Hertfordshire would have been delighted with the 124 that they made Suffolk pay.

### Marriott, Tyson stifle Suffolk threat

Suffolk's first opening pair of the season was a little different - while both Jess Board and Amelie Clarke have performed the role for the county before, Sunday was their first time together. They negotiated the first ten overs without loss, albeit only for 21 runs. Clarke looked fluent - hitting back to back fours off Reid - in progressing to 16.

However, she was soon accounted for by Tyson - trapped lbw. Despite her opening spell of 8 overs costing just 6 runs, Clarke's was the only wicket for Tyson at the top - although she did return to add two more later on. The pressure she built stifled any early hopes of Suffolk getting away, and she was ably backed up by Reid (4-1-15-0) and Phillips (7-0-17-1).

The introduction of Cunningham into the innings at number four looked to add some much needed impetus. She heaved Arrol over midwicket for 6, and looked good for more, before falling to the same bowler for 17. It was a similar story across the board for Suffolk, with the top five all getting to double figures and failing to go on. 

Hassall shuffled her pack to great effect, with ten bowlers used across the innings, and it was this that meant none of the batters could settle. The changes did not effect the quality, either: six bowlers chipped in with wickets. The penultimate bowler brought on was Marriott - her figures of 3-9 are more than you would generally expect of your seventh-change.

The Suffolk lower order resisted respectably - keeper CJ Oastler kept out 27 balls, Swinburne held out for 17. But both eventually fell to Marriott, as the visitors fell short - all out for 148.

Though not reflected in the margin of defeat, there were plenty of positives - bowling in particular - for Suffolk to take against a strong Hertfordshire team. And for those of us that had to brave the cold, that is some consolation.
