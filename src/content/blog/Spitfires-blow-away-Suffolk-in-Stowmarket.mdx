title: Spitfires blow away Suffolk in Stowmarket

##

Suffolk returned to Stowmarket CC for the second week running, hosting Kent in a blustery friendly. The visitors put up a steep first innings total of 241-8, led by Isla McCulloch's 85. They then backed it up by bowling Suffolk out for 155 in 43 overs, despite some late hitting by Maddy Reynolds, Liv Hyndman and Lauren Swinburne.

### McCulloch steers Kent through Suffolk assortment

For the first time in 2024, captain Swinburne lost the toss. Kent didn't begrudge their hosts their usual field-first strategy, though, choosing to bat.

Izzy Sidhu took the new ball - not for the first time this weekend, as she had done the same for Surrey against Middlesex on Saturday. There, she bowled Sunrisers batter Saskia Horley first ball; she had to wait a touch longer for the breakthrough against Kent, breaking the 40-run opening partnership in her sixth over.

Sidhu, with her sister Poppy at the other end, bowled tightly early on. Their lengths were consistent - the former bowling full, the latter banging it in short - stopping the visitors from getting away, with just one boundary in the first seven overs.

The floodgates did open eventually. McCulloch led the charge, with the first three fours coming off her bat through midwicket. She greeted seamer Amelie Clarke with a drive through the covers, although Clarke struck back in her second over: enticing Jodie Hobson into an off-drive, which found the hands of Olivia Locke.

Coco Streets was next to bat and added some impetus with four boundaries. The most outrageous of the quartet was a scoop to fine leg - off a Clarke free-hit, but impressive nonetheless. Swinburne conceded two fours through point, but hit back - catching Streets' straight drive from the last ball of the 18th over, before dismissing Helen Fagg-Lenihan lbw four overs later.

The drinks break was taken - in the chill of the wind - after 25 overs, with the innings finely poised at 114-4. Izzy Sidhu's quota was complete, returning figures of 1-38: Kent keeper Reese Nash had conceded upon getting out to the spinner that “the plan was to see her through”, and McCulloch had managed that, bringing up an unbeaten 50 in the 24th over. It was time to kick on.

The opener, alongside Izzy Kirby, negotiated the next ten overs from Immy Sidhu and Maddy Reynolds - their partnership of 66 was the highest of the innings. The pair took four leg-side fours in as many overs before Kirby offered up an easy return catch for Sidhu.

Amber Bradnam and Sophie Hughes took over bowling duties, and came up with a wicket each. The first of those was more costly: McCulloch and her captain Megan Belt put on a boundaryless 29 in 42 balls, before the former top-edged a Bradnam delivery to Reynolds and walked back for an impressive 85.

With the main threat removed, Suffolk went in for the kill. Clarke returned and produced a tight 45th over, before flattening Alice Grant's middle stump with a fizzing yorker in the 47th. Sandwiched in between was Hughes' wicket: a fuller delivery which was caught well by Belt but not well enough to clear Laila Hollis at cow corner.

9th-wicket pair Lucy Blincoe and Eleanor Jones wrestled momentum back to Kent, adding an unbeaten 30 in the last three and a half overs of the innings and guiding the visitors to a competitive 241. Suffolk showed off their bowling depth - with all eight bowlers producing solid displays - but needed to back it up with the bat.

### Late hitting not enough to scale hefty chase

Clarke and Jess Board were tasked with making the first dent in the target, and things started gently enough with five from Jones' first over. Things quickly tightened up, though: Jones' second over was a maiden, and Grant at the other end was both quick and accurate.

Things went from sedate to severe in the fourth over. Grant replicated her own dismissal - pegging back Clarke's middle stump - before clipping the top of Izzy Sidhu's off stump two balls later.

Board made a statement with Jones' next over: cutting a full toss to point, before unfurling a cover drive to bookend the over with boundaries. With Grant limiting the scoring at one end, Kent brought in Izzy Kirby to lock down the other and she had instant success: Board found the hands of mid-off with the bowler's second ball, departing for 16.

In all, overs 9 to 14 saw just eight runs as Suffolk tried to rebuild, through Immy Sidhu and Olivia Locke. Grant was removed from the attack - safe to say that was a relief, with her first six overs returning 2-7 - allowing Sidhu to break the shackles for a time. Three boundaries came in four overs, with a sweep through backward square leg followed by a pair of drives down the ground.

The loss of Locke - in the same fashion as Board - didn't deter Sidhu, with her reaching the ropes twice more (one through backward square leg, one down the ground). She ran several twos with Laila Hollis - the ball frustratingly not running as smoothly across the outfield as it did in Kent's innings - to keep the score ticking over.

The visitors employed an off-side heavy field to stall Suffolk, with just three fielders - mid-on, fine leg and midwicket - patrolling half of the ground. It needed accurate bowling to work, and Lilia Humphries and Lucy Blincoe obliged.

Eventually the pressure told. Both set batters were bowled in consecutive overs - Sidhu to the returning Grant, Hollis to the first ball of captain Belt's spell.

Belt - the leading wicket-taker in Kent's triumphant Twenty20 Cup campaign in 2013 - later struck twice in two balls, leaving her with figures of 3-3 from her first three overs. Sophie Hughes, looking to add some intent to the flailing innings, stepped down the pitch but was stumped; Poppy Sidhu was given out caught behind. The hat-trick delivery was tantalisingly close, but didn't stick in the bowler's hand.

You would never bet on the 9th wicket partnership being the highest of an innings, but given the calibre of the Suffolk batters involved it was no shock.

Maddy Reynolds set things in motion with a boundary through long-on, to bring up the team's 100 in the 34th over. Liv Hyndman then belted the Kent captain through midwicket, and repeated the stroke against Humphries. The boundary stream, paired with some good running, took the partnership to 40 before Hyndman skied to mid-on for a well-made 21.

The final four overs of the game were great entertainment. Lauren Swinburne blasted 16 off 12 balls, with Reynolds adding 12 off 11 as they hauled their team past 150. Belt would have been regretting bringing herself back into the attack, as the first nine balls of her return gave away three boundaries - two of which were crunched through midwicket by her Suffolk counterpart.

She had the last laugh though - having Reynolds caught for a defiant 29, to seal an 86-run victory.
