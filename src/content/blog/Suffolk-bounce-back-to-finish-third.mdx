##

Suffolk left Cornwall on Sunday with a win and a loss, to finish third in their Vitality Blast League 3 group. Cornwall defended 131 in the first game in Camborne, before Suffolk bowled their hosts out for 64 in a chase of 128.

A four-wicket over from Sophie Hughes meant that Cornwall were bowled out with an over to spare in the morning game. In reply, three Suffolk batters scored 29: openers Amelie Clarke and Charlotte Anderson set a platform, before Hughes - captaining her county for the first time - led the charge to the finish line, but fell 12 runs short.

Suffolk had their revenge, as Petra Tweedy's 54 helped set a target of 129 in the afternoon. Amber Bradnam then ripped the heart out of the chase, dismissing three of the top six. Contributions across the board meant Cornwall were bowled out for a second time in the day, to lose by 64 runs.

### *Cornwall (131) beat Suffolk (120) by eleven runs*

Cornwall won the first toss of the day, and chose to bat. Eleven runs came from both the second and fifth overs as the opening partnership grew rapidly. Captain Emily Edgcombe sent one over the ropes to bring up 50-0 in the seventh over.

Bradnam struck back, having Evie Privett caught at long-on. Three balls later, Immy Sidhu took a catch at midwicket to round out Bradnam's figures of 2-27.

Seamer Poppy Sidhu took a wicket with her first ball - caught by Charlotte Jenner, making her first competitive Suffolk appearance of the season. Sidhu had her second in her next over, as Karla Rose nicked a drive behind to Liv Hyndman.

Laila Hollis chipped in with a wicket to leave Cornwall 93-5. Edgcombe was still around, though, and reached her fifty with a square uppercut - one of four boundaries in the 14th over. Amelie Clarke removed her a couple of overs later, stumped by Hyndman for 66.

Hughes brought herself on, and conceded an early boundary to Tilly Eldridge - but she more than made up for it in her second over.

Cornwall were well set at 126-6 with two overs left. Hughes struck immediately, as the ball was helped up to Jenner at short leg. Hyndman then held onto a top-edge; Hughes was on a hat-trick.

The third ball was comfortably defended, but the spinner had Eldridge out lbw from her fourth. Finally, the sixth ball was chipped back at Hughes, who took a nonchalant catch above her head.

From a strong position, Cornwall had fallen to 131 all out with an over unused. All the momentum was on Suffolk's side going into the chase.

That seemed to be exactly the case, as Clarke swivel-pulled the second ball for four. Another boundary followed, and another, and one more: the opener was on 20 within the first two overs.

Anderson matched her partner's intent, cover driving for four before whipping a pair of boundaries through midwicket. Suffolk were 38-0 after just three overs.

Cornwall used a different bowler for each of the first eight overs, and it took until the sixth for a wicket to fall: Clarke was run out for 29.

The seventh and eighth bowlers each struck in their first over, to leave Suffolk 61-3 after eight - still on course to reach their target.

Joleigh Roberts had other ideas, having Anderson caught for 29. Nat Samuels struck a trio of boundaries, but was bowled by Roberts; Jenner suffered the same fate four balls later.

Hughes flayed a six down the ground, but with 39 needed from 5 overs and wickets falling fast, the game was in Cornwall's hands.

Roberts returned for her last over, and made it a good one - a double-wicket maiden - ending with 5-7 from her four overs.

As long as Hughes was at the crease, her side had hope, and she swept for four to keep the target in sight. Number eleven Bradnam played her role well - getting off strike at every opportunity - but Edgcombe bowled a tight last over, and Suffolk were all out for 120.

### *Suffolk (128-6) beat Cornwall (64) by sixty-four runs*

Clarke got things moving in the second game with a six, whipped over midwicket, in the third over after her side had won the toss and chosen to bat.

Tweedy was promoted to open, and seized the chance with a pair of boundaries. Clarke then found the rope in consecutive balls to lead the visitors to 43-0 at the end of the powerplay.

The partnership was broken on 51: Clarke was caught for 30. Anderson fell soon after, but Hollis drove for four through mid-off to steady the ship.

Two more quick wickets fell, bringing together Tweedy and Hughes. The pair put on 27 from 22, shifting the momentum back towards Suffolk.

Hughes was caught at midwicket, ushering in another quiet period - but Tweedy ran a single to deep midwicket to bring up her half-century in the 19th over.

Tweedy drove the first ball of the 20th for four, but found a fielder at mid-off from the second. Jenner and Immy Sidhu ran hard to get eleven from the over, and haul Suffolk to a respectable 128-6.

Sidhu's opening over was negotiated easily, but she played a crucial part in the breakthrough just a ball later. Bradnam's first legal delivery was skied up to mid-off, just behind the bowler; Sidhu sprinted from her position on the ring, and held the ball comfortably as it fell.

The spinner soon had a wicket of her own: Edgcombe swept her next ball straight to Jenner at square leg.

Bradnam had her next wicket thanks to a Hughes catch at extra cover, leaving Cornwall 34-3 from six overs.

Hughes brought herself on earlier after her heroics in the first game, and was rewarded with her fifth wicket of the day. Roberts had played nicely for 23, but the ball flew under her attempted sweep before spinning back to knock over the leg-stump.

Bradnam bowled Kellie Williams in her final over to finish with 3-14. Poppy Sidhu bowled a single over from that end and was successful: just two runs, for the wicket of Eldridge.

Hollis then got in on the action: she had Madie Webber stumped, before bowling Iona Pennington to leave the innings in tatters at 48-8.

Jenner came on and claimed her first senior Suffolk wicket - bowling Rose - before Cornwall's number eleven was run out.

The visitors were bowled out for 64, exactly half of Suffolk's total, with more than six overs remaining.

Next up for Suffolk is the reverse fixture, in a different format: Cornwall visit Ipswich School in the One-Day Cup on August 10th.
