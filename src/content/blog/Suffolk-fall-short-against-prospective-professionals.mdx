##

Suffolk Women got their County T20 season underway with a loss to Essex at Colchester.

The Castle Park ground was due to host three games on Sunday, with Essex, Kent and Suffolk playing two each.

Kent were the unfortunate party on the day: a wet outfield, along with the occasional shower, prevented their matches from taking place.

But as the rain gave way to a sunny afternoon, hopes of getting the final game on were lifted. Suffolk captain Lauren Swinburne won the toss, and put the hosts in to bat.

### Castle-led hosts break free

For an over, it was looking very good. A single from spinner Immy Sidhu's sixth ball allowed Katherine Speed, and Essex, to move off the mark.

Her opening partner, Grace Poole, started at the other end of the scale. Her first two deliveries, against another spinner in Sophie Hughes, were bowled full and dealt with in full - bringing a 4 and a 6.

The latter was judged too full, and brought a free hit. But Hughes dropped her length shorter, causing Poole to miss the ball in her stride down the wicket. Despite missing out, the opener was not deterred.

Sidhu's second over was greeted with three consecutive fours, again by Poole walking down the track. But the fifth ball was not timed so sweetly: her miscued shot ended up in the hands of Laila Hollis at point.

Still, an explosive cameo of 23 from 9 showed that Essex meant business.

Emily Cunningham's introduction slowed things down, with her first over going for 4 runs. But the next breakthrough came in the fifth over, delivered by seamer Megan Haynes.

Speed and Bella Howarth had already completed a relatively simple two before attempting a third, on a misfield. You know what they say. Cunningham's throw landed perfectly for keeper CJ Oastler to break the stumps, running out Howarth for 3.

Essex sensed the need for a rebuild, at 41-2. Speed looked relatively settled, but her strike rate was not one of a risk-taker. Just one boundary came in the five overs following the run-out: Speed rocking back and cutting behind square for four.

Tilly Callaghan ensured the runs kept flowing: despite the drought, her partnership with Speed was worth 43 in just over 7 overs. But it ended in the same manner as the last: a Cunningham-Oastler run-out. Speed was the victim this time around, falling for a steady 33 from 39 balls.

New Zealander Cunningham had already completed her quota of overs by this point, bowling unchanged from the Colchester Castle end. Tidy as ever, she finished how she started - conceding 4 from the over - ending with figures of 0-17.

Replacing her was Amelie Clarke, who took full advantage of the run-out. Despite bowling a wide at new batter Jess Bird, her radar readjusted quickly. Bird's stumps were not happy about this.

One of the many quirks of cricket is how quickly joy can turn to despair. Seeing a professional striding out - former Sunrisers captain Kelly Castle - must have taken away some of the elation of Clarke's wicket.

The more immediate issue, though, was Callaghan. A pair of boundaries from Clarke's next over - helped behind, and slapped through midwicket - were followed by a two to bring up 100 for the hosts.

Castle didn't take long to join the rampage. A swept four against Haynes was joined by one driven through long-on. A huge six, flying high over Sophie Singer's head at long-on, punctuated Sidhu's last over - although the spinner finished with a respectable 1-28.

The 19th over, delivered by Suffolk captain Swinburne, was taken for 16 runs. This included consecutive fours for Callaghan, allowing her to push a single and reach a well-deserved half-century - from 45 balls.

There was an air of authority about their partnership, which was worth 78 from just 49 balls. Castle's cameo in particular was effective and unrestrained; truthfully, it felt like watching a professional.

The only bowler who truly contained the pair was Sophie Hughes. Her last two overs, the 18th and 20th of the innings, went for just 13. And she was rewarded for her control: the last ball of the 20th saw Tilly Callaghan walk down the track, miss, and get stumped by Oastler. Though somewhat irrelevant, being the last ball of the innings, there is value in ending on a positive note.

### Suffolk siege on Castle Park thwarted

Suffolk's task - chasing 164 - was always daunting, and needed a very bright start. The opening pair - a left-right, Sophie-Sophie combination - has served the county well at under-18s level, but it was not their day today.

Grace Poole opened the bowling, with Essex taking the more conventional route of starting with pace. She was on the money straight away: her first over cost 3, while her second was a maiden.

More attention, however, was on the bowler at the other end. Esmae MacGregor, formerly of Suffolk and now a professional at Sunrisers, saw Sophie Singer - herself involved in the regional system - drive her through the leg-side for 4. An impressive feat considering the young seamer's last recorded wicket was Sophia Dunkley, who returned to the England squad on Sunday.

She was replaced by Tilly Callaghan, and the move paid dividends. On the last ball of the over, Hughes' middle stump was knocked back, bringing Emily Cunningham to the middle. But before she faced a ball, Singer was gone too. A lofted drive was not quite lofted enough, and ended up in the hands of midwicket.

Amelie Clarke joined Cunningham at the crease, and showed her intent with a boundary, successfully lifted this time through the leg-side. But the over was closed out with four more dots. Restricting singles means applying pressure, and Essex were doing so in spades.

An over from Jasmine Westley, costing 5 runs, closed out the powerplay: undoubtedly one in favour of the hosts, with Suffolk at 23-2. The required rate had already risen to above 10 an over, the openers were out - and the professionals had only bowled one over between them.

Cunningham and Clarke set about trying to rebuild. The early highlight was a beautifully timed boundary through the covers by the New Zealander, from the last ball of the eighth over. The following over, bowled by Westley, saw the duo run on each ball, before they reached a crescendo in Poole's tenth over. Aided by a pair of no balls, eleven came from it - but at 50-2 on the halfway mark, that same amount was needed every over.

MacGregor ended the partnership on 44 runs soon after. Returning for the twelfth over, she saw Cunningham dropped at deep backward square - although it would have been a magnificent feat, with the fielder running around the boundary and almost making it. But the opportunity came around soon after, as the batter was pouched at mid-wicket attempting another big shot.

Laila Hollis came in at 5, with the game - optimistically speaking - looking just out of reach. An admittedly impressive Essex appeal, asking for a catch by the keeper off the bowling of Callaghan, was turned down and Hollis soon moved off the mark with a single to square leg.

With the result all but safe, Suffolk were able to knock a few singles around. The runs never completely dried up: the late-innings highlight was a boundary swept behind square from Hollis. But she was bowled for 15 soon after by Davis, who returned tidy figures of 1-19, and that was that for finding the fence.

The visitors reached 88-4, with Clarke making an unbeaten 38, but fell short. Particularly in the fielding innings, they had Essex in trouble at times, but failed to land the killer blow. So the game finished aptly: with a swing and a miss.
