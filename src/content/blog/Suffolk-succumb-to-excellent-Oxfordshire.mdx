##

Suffolk opened their 2025 account with a 187-run loss over 50 overs at Kingston Bagpuize in Oxfordshire. Immy Sidhu stood out with 4-43 as Suffolk bowled their hosts out for 291, before top-scoring with 25 as the Oxfordshire attack - led by Italy international Emilia Bartram - sparked a Suffolk collapse of 6-18.

The visitors entered the brave new world of Tier 3 as a familiar side. With the exception of debutant Tamsin Holmes - a regular through Suffolk's age group system - the whole squad featured in 2024. Returning captain Lara Neild lost the toss and, with the sun shining, Oxfordshire elected to bat first.

Izzy Sidhu took the new ball and extracted enough bounce to make the batters nervous - there were a number of viable early lbw appeals. With Maddy Reynolds whizzing it through at the other end, Oxfordshire were forced into a sedate start - reaching 27-0 after nine overs.

The tides shifted quickly, as Genny Porter struck five boundaries in the next three overs. Neild brought on Immy Sidhu to slow the charge - a move which was quickly vindicated when she bowled Chloe Westbury with her fourth ball, having already seen a close call for a run-out off her first.

Her sister Izzy was well settled by this point, and benefited from Porter's decision to sweep on 47 to claim her first wicket. Her second followed in her next over - Sophie Mitchelmore bowled for a ten-ball duck. In all, the left-arm legspinner conceded just six runs from her last four overs.

Immy matched, and then bettered, Izzy in her next over. The first ball was fired in full and dug out by Mim Aldred (4), right into the hands of Sophie Hughes at cover. The fourth knocked over Charlotte Oxton's stumps.

That brought Oxfordshire captain Bartram to the crease, and she announced her arrival with a boundary. She carried on in the same vein, welcoming Hughes into the attack with a flurry of fours.

It fell to Immy Sidhu again to dismiss her: the last ball of a miserly over saw the batter miss, and the spinner hit.

Six down with only 111 on the board, Suffolk smelt blood as Sophie Grayson strode to the crease. The all-rounder was still in capable company, with Ellie Ingram (16) in the middle, but quickly made her intentions clear with a big six off Sidhu.

Immy missed out on her five-for, as Izzy put down a heave to deep midwicket - although the effort meant that the ball bounced before crossing the rope.

The batters feasted on a diet of dots and wallops for a few overs. In Hughes' sixth over, however, a fumble by Amelie Clarke at short man led to a risky single, which turned into a ridiculous second and saw Ingram walking back as CJ Oastler whipped the bails off.

Pace returned to the attack in the form of Lauren Swinburne for the 34th, and she struck quickly - removing Katie Waugh lbw for eight.

At 174-8, Grayson decided it was time to take charge. Arguably the shot of the day was a six off Hughes, serenely walloped dead straight into the sightscreen. She brought up her fifty soon after, turning one around the corner for four.

Captain Neild brought herself on, and found success in her second over - inducing a lovely edge through to Oastler.

Bowling at the number eleven, the game was firmly in Suffolk's hands. Maya Barnwell, however, struck a boundary off Neild with confidence that belied her batting position.

Grayson was motoring along already, but she seemed to find another gear from the 45th over. Sixes off Reynolds and Neild took her to 94.

Tamsin Holmes had the challenge of stopping her charge to a century, but could only watch as the batter found the square boundary on each side. Barnwell hit consecutive boundaries of her own, before Grayson's final assault - three fours in a row - led the hosts to a formidable 291.

The tenth-wicket partnership of 79 turned an innings of ebbs and flows into a torrent, headed firmly towards Oxfordshire.

Clarke and Jess Board were given the task of swimming head-first into it. Board began well, flaying the second ball through point for four. The optimism was short lived, though, as Bartram drew an edge to the keeper.

Despite the occasional wayward wide from either side, the home bowling was tight and consistent. Clarke connected well with a few, but the fielders did their part - stopping what they could in the ring, and chasing the rest right to the rope. Their effort was impressive on a bumbly outfield, which had caused Suffolk a few problems.

Clarke fell for 9 off the bowling of Bartram, nailing one low into the hands of point. That brought Immy and Izzy Sidhu together at the crease, and the former found the boundary quickly. The latter, however, also fell to Bartram - lbw on the back foot.

Poppy Sidhu then joined her sister, and the pair combined to take 22 from the 11th and 12th overs. Immy nicked behind, though, to end a promising innings on 25.

Liv Hyndman cracked a pair of boundaries to propel Suffolk to 85-4 in the 15th over - going quickly enough to be on course, but having lost too many wickets.

That was when the proper slide began. Ellie Ingram took her second, then third catch to see off Sidhu and Hyndman. Hughes was introduced to give a left-right combination, frustrating the fielders - but she didn't trouble the scorers in the same way, being run out for 4.

The chase was subsiding quickly, but there was still time for a moment of Oxfordshire brilliance. It was Grayson again: Holmes drove the ball back to her, and she took an excellent catch in her follow-through. Lauren Swinburne was then caught by Bartram at slip in the same over.

Spots of rain accompanied last man Neild to the crease, and by the time Maddy Reynolds fell lbw for 5, Suffolk had been washed away.
