title: Surrey keep Steely grip on opening fixture

Cameron Steel joked in a recent interview that his new moustache was his way of bringing “a bit of Australia back here.” If his facial hair was reminiscent of an Australian fast bowler, his batting most certainly wasn't. Steel moved from 86 overnight to an unbeaten 141; his 55 runs this morning came from just 44 balls, including two sixes in three balls off England legspinner Matt Parkinson.

Sean Abbott could only add eight to his 34 before Tom Bailey trapped him lbw for his fourth wicket. Kemar Roach then added 57 for the ninth wicket alongside Steel, before departing on 18 - the same score as Dan Worrall managed at 11. Worrall, however, took 35 fewer balls for his: all eighteen came from boundaries. His cameo left the visitors with a first innings total of 442.

Keaton Jennings, last year's Division One top run scorer, had received a relatively chastening introduction to the Lancashire captaincy with the Surrey lower order wreaking havoc. In the response, however, Jennings led by example: the only flaw in his sturdy 76 was his failure to kick on. Sean Abbott's debut wicket had opening partner Luke Wells gone for 24 to a sharp slip catch by England's Ollie Pope. However, Wells' loose drive was one of a number of reckless batting decisions by Lancashire which ultimately left them 8 down at the close.

Josh Bohannon fed one down Abbott's throat at cover. Steven Croft pulled an Abbott bouncer to Roach at long leg. Ex-captain Dane Vilas chopped on; new captain Jennings didn't even hit it. Keeper George Bell helped a wide Abbott ball on to keeper Ben Foakes. Luke Wood and Tom Bailey, the early segments of a long Lancashire tail, both played nothing shots to midwicket.

Though this might make dire reading for Lancastrians, their day was not without some success. Former New Zealand international Colin de Grandhomme fought to an unbeaten 29 at the close, joined by Will Williams' defiant 19 not out. And within their slightly haphazard 233-8 there were some definite bright sparks: Jennings' half-century chief amongst them. In a match where Jamie Smith painted a beautiful picture of the future of England's middle order just yesterday, Josh Bohannon demonstrated signs of his intention to join him within his 39-ball 32. George Bell, in only his third first class game, began with a boundary and hit two more on his way to 20. Bell also demonstrated his potential to challenge Smith for the gloves, with four catches and a stumping.

Talk of the future is all well and good; Keaton Jennings' side will be hoping that they can come good over the next two days, in their attempt to dent Surrey's title challenge before they fly out of reach.
