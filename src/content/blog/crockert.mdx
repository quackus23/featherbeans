## County Championship Day One: A day of rain, pain (for the bowlers) and Dane Paterson

### Debutants foiled by Dane

You would have expected more worry from Essex fans, on the eve of their first season since 2003 without Sir Alastair Cook at the top of the order. But, as they say, there’s always another former Test captain where that one came from. 86 balls into Dean Elgar’s impressive debut, and a first Essex half-century had shrunk that 27000-run hole by, well, 50.

Impressive debuts were the order of the day: Dan Lawrence’s absence was mitigated by a superb 84 for Jordan Cox. After the losses of Feroze Khushi for 18 (including the first six of the season, smashed over mid-on off Dillon Pennington) and captain Tom Westley for 7, the two sensibly put on 112 runs across 30 overs.

Elgar’s dismissal signalled the start of more South African brilliance. Bowling his compatriot for 80, Dane Paterson then saw off Critchley, Walter and Rossington for just 24 runs within 10 overs. Paired with the earlier edge of Westley, the veteran seamer had the season’s first 5-wicket haul - and his team in an infinitely better position.

Suddenly becoming the senior batter, Cox had the unenviable task of shepherding the tail through the storm. While he and Harmer - for once not the most impressive Protea of the day - survived 10 overs, they only yielded 23 and their resistance was ended by all-rounder Lyndon James. His dismissals of Harmer and Snater sandwiched legspinner Calvin Harrison’s dismantling of Cox’s stumps, only a few short of a debut hundred.

This final act from the Nottinghamshire bowlers brought the Essex new ball pairing out, with clouds around - you’d think they would’ve been happier if knocked over first ball. The clouds persisted, though, leaving Cook and Porter unbeaten at stumps - 6 runs away from a first batting point of the season.

### Worcestershire avoid the rain?

Worcestershire’s promotion parade has been well and truly rained on this winter - their home suffering 7 floods, ending up out of action until at least mid-May. So it came as a surprise when only a few miles up the road, at the neighbours’, theirs was the one division one match to begin on time.

And there was no waiting around. By the time Jake Libby fell for 38, 14 overs in, the Pears had taken the Bears for a bit of a mauling. Aggressive-fruit-in-chief was wicketkeeper Gareth Roderick, who began the innings with a four off Oliver Hannon-Dalby. While forced to slow his progress considerably - Will Rhodes, free from the captaincy, looked like a new bowler - the tone had been set.

The only batter to better Roderick’s 68 was South Asian Cricket Academy graduate Kashif Ali, bringing up his maiden first-class ton in his 15th innings. And he did it in style - on 97, he swatted Danny Briggs over his head for 6. His innings, exceptional though it was, propped up an otherwise patchy show from the middle order - new signing Rob Jones nicking one on the leg side through to Michael Burgess. Number 8 Matthew Waite took one disdainful look at his position - one lower than he’d perhaps like, due to the presence of former West Indies Test captain Jason Holder - and smashed 37 off 42 in response. Dominating a partnership alongside a Test double-centurion isn’t bad for a bowler from Leeds.

The Warwickshire bowlers, though initially expensive, would be happy with their collective efforts in restricting the visitors to 316/7. Every bowler, excluding the one over of Rob Yates’ offbreaks, took at least a wicket - and the most impressive showings came from seamers in their top six, in the form of Rhodes and Ed Barnard. Not many teams have room to pick four genuine spinners, and only use two.

### No settling in for Simpson

Over the winter, John Simpson ventured south after 15 years at Middlesex. Having initially asked for a bit of time to acclimatise to the surroundings at Sussex, the veteran keeper accepted the red-ball captaincy - at least for the start of the season.

That bedding in period lasted all of three overs, before Simpson dived to his right to catch Emilio Gay down the leg side.

Of course, he had enjoyed four hours of rain before getting on the field, and was doubtless just wanting to get on with things. Another debutant, the Trinidadian Jayden Seales, took this frustration out on Gay - and later had his opening partner, Justin Broad, leg before. After a looser opening spell, Seales bowled superbly in tandem with England’s Ollie Robinson - the latter returning figures of 9-4-14-0, reflecting his effortless yet wicketless control.

The Northamptonshire captain Luke Procter had accumulated 41 unbeaten runs by the time the clouds returned, striking at only 37 despite a six and four fours. Alongside Indian Test triple-centurion Karun Nair (12\*), he will hope for a longer stretch of time to bat - warding off both the weather and the ghost of last year’s largely abysmal batting performances.

### Glamorgan cash in against cashless Middlesex

Having seen last year’s stand-in opener retire, in Andrew Salter, and his senior partner - club captain David Lloyd - leave for Derbyshire, Glamorgan fans would have possibly at least asked the question: can we have another opener? Please?

And that was before the reliable Eddie Byrom got injured.

If you then told those fans that the first 2nd-wicket partnership of the season would be worth 129, even after Zain-ul-Hassan fell for just 5, the answer would have been something like ‘oh. Okay then.’

English cricket fans have spent years reacting to crises with the word ‘Root’. And though the Root was different, the outcome today was the same: younger brother Billy slotting in at the top and scoring 67. His partner-in-crime for much of this time was his new skipper: Sam Northeast hitting the summer’s first century, on his first outing as Glamorgan’s permanent red-ball captain.

Glamorgan had never looked in any trouble after being put in to bat, with the three Middlesex wickets separated by over 100 runs each. After Root came Carlson; after him, Colin Ingram; promised at some point on day two to the home bowlers, a rematch with Chris Cooke, plunderer of a 38-ball hundred in last year’s Blast.

Henry Brookes, debuting for Middlesex, broke the first big partnership - telling Root to follow his off stump back to the dressing room. However, none of the bowlers could keep the pressure on - Tom Helm in particular coming in for harsh treatment with 0-79 (13). Carlson hit a fluent 77, the fifty brought up in tandem with Northeast’s 150, before being disappointingly caught at short cover.

The bowler in this case was the ever-impressive Ethan Bamber, who had earlier nicked off Zain for the first wicket of the season. John Simpson’s absence behind the stumps was never felt, with Jack Davies doing an impressive job, although emulating him in front of the stumps will surely be just as large a challenge.

Colin Ingram, now a Glamorgan man of nearly ten years, walked out to join Northeast and serenely escorted him home to stumps - the latter needing only 14 to add the summer’s first double-hundred to his record.

### Hill to climb for Leicestershire

George Hill spearheaded the initial stages of Yorkshire’s attempts to avoid the upset they suffered in this fixture at the start of the 2023 season. On a day where his four senior seamers largely struggled, he came away boasting three valuable wickets.

Delayed due to weather until 3:40, Rishi Patel and Marcus Harris would have been happy for something to do when Yorkshire put them in first. After seeing off the new ball pairing relatively comfortably, Patel’s furniture was given a nice makeover by Matt Milnes - not before adding 43 for the first wicket. This was replicated for the second - Louis Kimber at 3, tasked with filling the shoes of Colin Ackermann, was taken low at second slip for 24 off Hill.

Harris, starting his third stint at the county after time away with Gloucestershire, looked as home as he hit 12 fours to reach 56. However, even he could not escape the clutches of Hill - out caught by Harry Brook. Neither could Leicestershire’s captain, and their Hill, Lewis Hill - caught for 5.

A counterattack was probably necessary, but whether it was or not, Rehan Ahmed would still have done it. His highly entertaining 28 off 22, though, was ended with under three overs to go in the day. Dan Moriarty was the culprit this time - taking his first wicket in this permanent stint at Yorkshire, in the second of three miserly overs. While 164/5 is not where Leicestershire would have wanted to end a truncated day one, they can take courage from both their batting depth - 3 still to come - and the presence of Peter Handscomb on 20\*.

For Yorkshire: their frontline seamers may have to tighten up if the division two title is to be the cakewalk many expect from them - but in Hill, they have a serious talent coming through in both disciplines.
